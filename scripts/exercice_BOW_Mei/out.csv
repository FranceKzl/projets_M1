 spoilers i was very curious to see this film after having heard that it was clever and witty i had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom i felt the idea behind the film would have been acceptable: depicting the way the relationship between a man and a woman evolves through all the problems and difficulties that two people living in a big city can experience what made me dislike the whole film were two things first of all the film was so down-to-earth that it looked as if by describing the problems that a couple must solve on a day-to-day basis it became itself ordinary and dull secondly the overall sloppiness of the production with dialogues that were barely understandable too bad 	NEG
i just sat in the theater bored as hell i wanted to leave halfway through the movie the plot is simple samoan guys wreck weddings so they have to bring a dates in order to get into the wedding yawn the thing that peeved me off the most was the so-called crude jokes they were highly unfunny clichéd and thrown in your face to make you get into the already dull movie the acting was below-average and i felt this movie just went on and on about nothing but a bunch of unfunny jokes and a predictable plot all in all one of the worse movies i ve seen of unfunny bad acting just ugly well thank god a friend shouted me avoid 	NEG
this movie commits what i would call an emotional rape on the viewer the movie supposedly caused quite a stir among the critics in cannes but for me the final scene was just a pathetic attempt for a newbie director to get himself noticed hardly a voice in the discussion on the issue of violence drug abuse or juvenile delinquency or any other issue for that matter the main character s metamorphosis from good but troubled boy to the vicious rapist is virtually nonexistent whereas the rape scene being an over-dragged exaggerated version of the rape scene from a clockwork orange is unbearable and i refuse to comment on its aesthetic values there are some things an artist should not do to try and achieve his her goal at least in my opinion to wrap it up: shockingly brutal revolting and not worth your time see a clockwork orange or le pianiste instead 	NEG
i went to see this movie at our college theater thirty years ago because i liked bruce dern in silent running and family plot to this day sorry jack nicholson it is still the dullest movie i ve ever seen it just went on and on with no discernible point and then - it just ended the lights came up and i watched everyone looking around in confusion had the projectionist missed a reel i ve never had the urge to find out all i remember about the movie is that it was a non-drama about some annoying college basketball players and their coach the most enjoyable part of the movie was watching the totally mystified audience afterwords fortunately this was just an exception for jack bruce and karen black 	NEG
from the awful death scenes to guns that fire without making sounds to a character called the fiend it s all tiresome slow moving unimaginative drivel it was ok seeing the guy with the cape and the hunchback lurking around visually it was creepy and probably occupied the moviegoer of the time but even in one would think that there would have been a little more imagination and verisimilitude to even a film like this i just kept waiting for something to happen of any importance as people stood around making speeches and acting like they were posing at an office picnic and then there are those bullets as a previous commentator mentioned perhaps the best clue would have been to search for a water spot on someone s pants pocket 	NEG
spoilers first off nothing really happened in this movie other than a woman bleeding inexplicably second it wasn t scary third it had the worst soundtrack of any movie ever let me elaborate the sound was edited by either beavis or butthead  i m not sure which so let s just go with beavis the movie gradually gets more and more quiet and the people mumble and mutter forcing you to turn up the volume i watched this at home then beavis blasts some really loud sounds with supposedly scary shocking images forcing you to quickly lower the volume again this occurs many times until mercifully the movie ends i can picture beavis laughing vulgarly from behind the two-way mirror while watching the test group franticly reaching for the remote each time if you have children and prefer to watch scary movies after they fall asleep this one is a big mistake but then it s a big mistake anyway here s a thought  if you re going to make a horror movie at least add a gratuitous beheading a -year-old blond girl who screams at the top of her lungs just before she can take off her sweater the shadow on the wall of someone being eaten alive just out of the camera range a cat being thrown at the camera to scare the audience some drifty weirdo with a maniacal laugh or a monster who looks like a stage hand covered in aluminum foil a la tv s lost in space these people didn t even try to scare me they just wanted to hurt my ears 	NEG
okay so i went into this movie not really expecting much i figured an action flick similar to the fast and the furious some nice cars some nice girls somewhat of a decent plot unfortunately i would have to say that this was probably the worst movie i have seen this year don t get me wrong the cars were nice and the girls were ok but the way they put the movie together was just plain crappy to put it nicely the story just never made you care about the cast and the movie seemed just pieced together so overall this movie was not the worst thing ever by far but if your looking for a movie to go to this weekend i would pass on this one for now 	NEG
råzone is an awful movie it is so simple it seems they tried to make a movie to show the reel life just like zappa did many years ago but unfortunately denmark lacks good young actors leon are by many still the little girl in krummernes jul and laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role several times in the movie she plays with out soul and this is destroying the movie even though i consider it a movie you ought to see i do not agree that the youth are behaving like this but i think it can show how it can end if you are letting your child down also it is important to support danish movies and new companies like film folket all in all i think people should see råzone not because it is a great film but because it is a movies which is dealing with important themes i also think it is important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it and actually it is in these scenes laura is acting best - like the ending where she is holding the gun 	NEG
this is supposed to be well-researched and based on fact how come therefore that it s so packed with mcgovernisms did the people of derry live in some kind of bizarre philip k dick world in which reality was uncannily like cracker liam priest or is mcgovern an idle hack who just keeps repeating hims	NEG
hey if your going to make a documentary about leonard cohen try making it about leonard cohen this is filled with only enough leonard to anger the viewer who will be left wondering why they are listening to all these other singers some of them questionable talk about themselves puleeze sounds like them reliving their diary entries in junior high - who cares about you what about leonard guess what people if you do something worthy maybe someone will make a documentary about you i found particularly insulting the parading of u s members as if that would add credibility to this movie - not leonard doesn t need bono or the edge talking about his spirituality what would have been nice would have been for the filmmakers to embody some piece of his spirituality through the film gee what a concept i will give props to rufus wainwright and jarvis cocker for their covers of cohen tunes - the rest of the performances were a bore and some were unbearable cohen fans don t say i didn t warn you 	NEG
while it contains facts that are not widely reported it is not exactly the truth they took a lot of liberties in rearranging events excluding people and using sets that do not meet the facts of their lives in the s there were more than just bonnie clyde and w d in the gang at various times and those people had as much to do with the facts as those included buck and blanche went to convince clyde to go straight much earlier than the one shootout and in fact got drawn back into crime some of the events that were portrayed in daylight actually took place at night bonnie s wound was much more severe and never healed right it was so bad she had to be carried around by someone until it healed up and even then it stiffened up so she walked stiffly clyde also walked with a limp because while in prison he cut off a big toe i know i m being nit picky and it was a tv movie but even without these factual errors in this true story the movie moves too fast from event to event and comes across more as several separate snapshots of their lives rather than being a cohesive flowing story i d recommend reading a book or seeing a documentary if you want to get closer to the truth 	NEG
jimmy dean could not have been more hammy or absurdly loutish hysterical if viewed through the eyes of mystery science theatre which i rate as a i mean the sight of this obese corn-fed hog trouncing around malta should be enough to send you to the vomitory if you make it that far into the film this ugly hysterical farce should be placed with the likes of booty call pumpkinhead swarm and the smurfs go to bangladesh a -gulp- film like this proves that sometimes actors writers producers etc get behind on their mortgage or get stoned to the point of insanity it begs the question who was so stupid to finance such a whale but then had good judgment prevailed and final justice never was then we wouldn t have the delightful spoof voice-over in mystery science theatre 	NEG
well i m blowed a woody allen film that i walked out of after half an hour i m aware of the moral fragility of commenting on a film of which i ve seen less than half but i hope you ll understand why basically it became apparent very early on that we were going to be patronised from the screen with: a script that set out its conceit as if with bullet points; a cast that were all trying to be characters from hannah and her sisters with the exception of chloe sevigny and were badly directed into doing so; and a camera that sat around portentously only for there to be nothing to film but chat and the actor delivering it drama none; it s partially pre-narrated but the action does nothing to develop a dramatic situation maybe i did leave too early in this case but by then i d decided against another hour and a half of one-liner-allen clones the script has its funny moments  i went almost entirely on the back of will ferrell s excerpts in the trailer trailer-hooked again doh  but there s little pace to let them fly off nonchalantly as is best worse than this there s no fluidity saying this film s wooden makes a forest look like a jelly: the opening café-bound discussion being the most abject case-in-point the only thing that should be done by numbers is potted reviewing  	NEG
never saw the original movie in the series i only hope it was a much better movie than this or the sequel made in the s as if it is not how were these two terrible sequels even justified this movie had a really good lead in when they were advertising it to be shown on one of those old independent stations that are a thing of the past now anyways it looked like it would be a pretty good scary movie it was however a movie that would make some walt disney movies look dark really this movie was just a bunch of light fluff with virtually no boggy creek creature to be seen the only real sighting is near the end when you see its shape during a very heavy rainstorm other than that there is virtually no sign of the creature which was really disappointing as a kid the story is basically the old evil hunters must kill anything they see and are after the boggy creek creature and kids are out to help it or just some random hairy guy in the woods that likes to pull random boats through the water not really worth watching i would however like to see the original granted the maker of that would make the also bad boggy creature of the s but he also made a very good slasher movie in the s the town the dreaded sundown 	NEG
be warned: this movie tells lots of love stories without any coherence the only intention of this movie seems to be showing love in many different ways each story has only a few minutes so there is no development of characters and nearly no plot just an sketchy idea of a plot the writer tried to build in turning points that aimed to surprise the viewer however that just didn t work out because you didn t get to know the characters in before or these jokes were just silly this is a movie about love that fails to reach your heart a dozen times or even more i don t know and i don t care 	NEG
i think this is probably one of the worst movies i ve watched in a long time trying to get the same characters with different people is such a bad idea if they couldn t get sara michelle g and ryan p in this one they should have just cut their losses and said to heck with it instead they get new actors that are horrible at what they did i seriously felt like i was at a high school or bad college play with the lever of acting these people put forth where do they get some of these people was this their first movie it sure seemed like it this movie also parallels the original in a few lines of speech i had just got done watching the first one and popped # in i was all excited to get to watch the second one and it ended up being the worst show i ve seen in a while i don t hardly ever ever turn off a movie but this one definitely went off after about - min 	NEG
we bought this film from a shop called poundland we were looking for more inspiration as we have previously bought the film no big deal an remade it we expected this film to be badly inspirational so that we might remake it and put it on the tube however this was shocking boring is the main word that comes to mind the bad effects and script aren t enough to make you watch it the main woman s body seems to be whipped out at opportune moments in a pathetic attempt to keep the viewer interested however it just makes you wonder did they blow the budget getting her to take her clothes off if so i d have asked for a refund it looks like a homemade film the shots don t even correspond with each other and the camera work is so amateur it makes our remakes of bad movies look professional i cannot believe that this is being sold as a marketable product it is just boring and ugly to watch the actors are bad and there is no degree of professionalism about it there are no words to describe how terrible it is 	NEG
i really do fail to see the actual surplus value of this movie it s not bad enough to be hilarious there s no sleaze or gratuitous nudity although there was plenty of opportunity there s no gore there s no suspense in the first hour of the movie cause there s way to much scenes of tourist having a party and natives playing funky tribal music that last part was actually funny on many occasions: you see these natives hitting congas and jembés and that s indeed what you hear badly synchronized on the soundtrack but they also added this funky bass-line on the soundtrack so where was the bass-player at one point the natives get angry and start killing the tourists why all of the sudden it s supposed to be because the evil white men build this tourist complex which according to their myth awakened the wrath of the river-alligator-god i actually missed the explanation for that one but the natives did help for several months to build the tourist complex so why the sudden angriness and how in the hell did they manage to push the helicopter in the water it s all silly and pointless this movie also features the skinniest afro-american model i ve ever seen at one point our heroic leading couple visits this cave where a weird crazy old man lives the only point to that scene is that they make the shocking discovery that the killer-crocodile is actually an alligator crocodile or alligator what s the difference it s big it s made out of plastic and it eats people all the same to me the alligator is a rather silly creation it s very stiff & motionless and doesn t even flap its feet when it swims the eyes don t even move when they re shot in close-up i guess they didn t know animatronics back then in italy during there s also a lot of pointless inter-cut shots of the local wildlife i suspect it s stock footage like i said the first hour was pretty lame and the only reason i didn t switch off the movie was because my cat was asleep on my lap and i didn t want to wake the sweet thing but the last half hour of the movie did get better we finally get to see some action when the alligator swims through a horde of panicking people snapping its teeth and munching on them the most entertaining and at the same time funny scene is when alice and daniel drive a van over a bridge and it collapses we re looking at a matchbox-version of the van falling in the river here funny but nicely shot in fact there are several other nice traveling camera-moves surprisingly for this type of flick i was gonna point out some stupid details concerning the end of the movie but i don t wanna spoil it completely in case you do decide to watch this movie my advice is to stay away from it if you wanna see a decent alligator movie then see lewis teague s alligator i admit that one isn t italian and isn t a jaws rip-off but it certainly is more fun and if you re interested in other movies made by director sergio martino then i strongly recommend the highly entertaining : after the fall of new york that one s an over-the-top rip-off of every possible existing post-apocalyptic-future-of-doom-movie italians and rip-offs two words that go together very well 	NEG
 nat voiced by trevor gagnon along with his brainiac friend iq voiced by philip bolden and the always hungry scooter david gore are kids with big dreams they want to be the first flies in space and what encourages their dreams is the first spacecraft to land on the moon the apollo is waiting for its historic trip on the launch pad near where the three hang out the first thing you notice is the animation of the film i found it done very well done the scenery had depth to it as things in the distance actually looked like they were behind the focus of the scenes i didn t see the movie in -d as it was broadcast on hbo however i could see that there really wasn t any scenes which took advantage of the -d effects except a fight between characters near the end i also wasn t really impressed with the design of the characters to me they didn t look like anything resembling a fly especially in the coloring the flies were an unusual blue-gray that was kind of distracting to me the performances from the cast was not bad but it wasn t good either there were many times i focused more on my computer than the story the writing was certainly written for a younger audience with comedic moments that will make younger kids laugh i saw nothing for adults like jokes that they ll get the punchline for the adults to understand the meaning history was not followed in this film in fact i think it was completely ignored as the main focus was the flies i also hated when a well known astronaut popped up on the screen and explained that the stories about the flies in the film was a work of fiction and no flies were on apollo i did like how he thanked the men and women who sacrificed their lives for space exploration though if you are an adult this is not for you it was not made for the entire family this is certainly just for kids but save this one for a rainy day 	NEG
i sort of accidentally ended up watching this movie i m still not sure if i regret it or not i felt like i was watching the film made by that group of film school students that didn t quite make the cut it plays up every hollywood cliché imaginable all the while flogging us with the corporations are the ultimate evil message subtlety this movie does not know as far as that goes it even manages to provide it s own spoilers the story appears to be a computer nerd s fantasy world come true the lead character is an attractive teenage boy with a girlfriend yet is a programming genius and apparent hacker i think among many other nerd-fantasy-come-true elements that you ll have to see for yourself as well i should ve known it would be a z-movie when i saw ned bellamy he tends to be a good tip-off can t recommend this one i m afraid 	NEG
this film had such promise what a great idea an underdog paintball team struggling for recognition and personal glory only to lose it s speed due to bad dialoge poor editing and a half-written story the characters in the beginning were interesting only to lose steam half way through to become one dimensional people sputtering out tired one-liners maybe if they spent some more time on the story and dialoge it would have been a great movie instead of a almost afterthought effort 	NEG
i m basing this on my observations of one episode i saw last night i don t think i ll be watching again the acting was totally wooden the plot completely predictable the ending totally unrealistic -- i mean who would believe a million dollar judgment for the death of a recovering drug addict with terminal cancer the lead actor victor garber seemed so uncomfortable almost embarrassed in his role -- perhaps he realized how bad the writing was i fully realize that the drama offered this season is pretty poor but they can surely find better writers maybe they are outsourcing the writing to india or china i ll bet we won t be seeing this one next season 	NEG
forbidden siren is based upon the siren playstation so many s game like most video game turned movies i would say the majority don t translate into a different medium really well and that goes for this one too painfully there s a pretty long prologue which explains and sets the premise for the story and the mysterious island on which a writer leo morimoto and his children daughter yuki yui ichikawa and son hideo jun nishiyama come to move into the villagers don t look all too friendly and soon enough sound advice is given about the siren on the island to stay indoors once the siren starts wailing naturally and slowly things start to go bump and our siblings go on a mission beating around the bush to discover exactly what is happening on this unfriendly island with its strange inhabitants but in truth you will not bother with what s going on as folklore and fairy tales get thrown in to convolute the plot even more what was really pushing it into the realm of bad comedy are its unwittingly ill-placed-out-of-the-norm moments which just drew pitiful giggles at its sheer stupidity until it s explained much later it s one thing trying to come up and present something smart but another thing doing it convincingly and with loopholes covered despite it clocking in under minutes - i think it s a horror movie phenomenon to have that as a runtime benchmark - it gives that almost two hour feel with its slow buildup to tell what it wants to things begin to pick up toward the last minutes but it s a classic case of too little too late what saves the movie is how it changes tack and its revelation at the end again this is a common device used to try and elevate a seemingly simple horror movie into something a little bit extra in the hope of wowing an audience it turned out rather satisfactorily but leaves a bad aftertaste as you ll feel cheated somewhat there are two ways a twist will make you feel - it either elevates the movie to a memorable level or provides you with that hokey feeling unfortunately forbidden siren belonged more to the latter the saving grace will be its cinematography with its use of light shadows and mirrors but i will be that explicit - it s still not worth the time so better to avoid this 	NEG
i m sure this was one of those woah attractions in when epcot opened but now it s just silly the film s message is cliché the circle-vision is disorienting and that awful song at the end is grating and i really wish they d install seats after so much walking all you want to do is sit down for a few minutes and when you hear there s a film to see it sounds pretty glamorous you get entertained while sitting down right wrong you re standing there for + minutes leaning against a short little railing disney should make a newer maelstrom like attraction to liven things up and replace this dull lackluster film not fun skip it in fact skip canada altogether unless you re eating there move directly to the united kingdom 	NEG
karen bobbie phillips mentions after one of her kids gets out of hand with his lame annoying jokes that she ll never survive this trip boy is she ever on the money karen is a school teacher taking her group of kids from the shepley college of historical studies to the butt ugly locale of a run-down manor in the major dung-heap of ireland surely there are places in this country more appeasing to the senses than this the caretaker of the manor gary simon peacock warns karen and her students to stay on the path and not to stray into the forest there s a myth regarding the sawney bean clan a ritualistic druid cannibalistic inbred family celebrate samhain the end of summer october st feast of the dead where sacrifices are needed to appease the spirits gary is supposedly clairvoyant his cousin pandora ginger lynn allen tells us because he was born on samhain funny because he sure doesn t see outcomes well or even give advice accurately nearly everyone dies even those who never stray from the path and he doesn t even see his own gruesome fate what this monster we hear breathing is a victim of way too much inbreeding it s face resembles a malformed mushroom and it looks like a hideous reject from a mad max picture it doesn t take long before the evil breeder is killing everyone paul howard rosenstein is karen s love interest who made the wrong decision coming to ireland without his girlfriend s prior knowledge horrible formula slasher doesn t stray from the norm it s minuscule budget shows loudly and the characters are assembly line clichés churned out yet again to be slaughtered in the usual gory ways most of the violence flashes across the screen quickly with not much dwelling on the breeder s acts of death towards his victims lots of guts get pulled out during the fast edit cuts as one scene whisks to another seeing gillian leigh s gorgeous naked body for a moment or two isn t incentive enough to recommend it phil price has the really irritating trickster character steve often shedding bad jokes how he is able to get leigh s barbara naked in the shower for some action is anyone s guess because i have no reason why he d stand a chance with such a hottie brandi-ann milbrant has the fortunate role of shae the quiet virgin smart girl who is also quite hot who we know will be the one chosen by the screenplay to survive jenna jameson drops by long enough to get her heart cut out of her chest at least we see her breasts momentarily before her chest is opened up with a few minor lines about two missing friends she s looking for the film s main problem is that the story and character development grinds to a halt because it s realized that none of them are at all interesting so director christian viel just lets loose his monster to run rampant causing carnage obliterating an entire cast almost in one fail swoop within ten minutes oh and richard grieco has a minor opening cameo as a victim who strayed off the path to tent camp with his chick 	NEG
if you are planning to rent or buy this movie don t it s the worst thing i have ever seen i would comment on it more but it has been years since i saw it and have blanked all of it from my mind save yourself some time money and well being and stay far far away 	NEG
this movie was so bad i couldn t sit through it without doing something else there was no plot and no point i was thoroughly bored and for a film about a stand up comedian i couldn t recall one joke or funny line worthy of the description politicians with no charisma speaking technical jargon could not be less entertaining so how was this made is there no quality control in film watching the girls in bikinis was the only distraction during this horrible experience it s hard to imagine that adam sandler who has become popular and has appeared in fine comedies was able to survive after this kind of exposure he was not funny in the least in this movie so it proves that the writing is so vital in effective comedy 	NEG
this film has its share of negative comments and i have to agree with those who consider it one of the worst movies ever made true most of the films based on the works of king are pretty bad but this one goes beyond bad into the realm of horrible there is not one scary moment in it unless you consider stupidity scary it is typical king garbage -- myths twisted around that made no sense in the first place mixed with obvious and belabored so-called scares that are about as shocking as peewee s playhouse which at least is entertaining it is full of ridiculous moments not the least of which is alice krige s character when she goes on a rampage and starts quipping like the villain in an old batman tv show it is so absurd as to be sickening all the people who had cameos in this including john landis are lucky they still have careers but the most absurd part has to be the cat costumes towards the end which look like cheap rubber outfits someone bought at k-mart the best part of the movie is the appearance of some real cats who actually out-act the people in the movie 	NEG
i was not impressed about this film especially for the fact that i went to the cinema with my family in good faith to see a film which was certificate rated a here in the uk to my dismay this film was full of embarrassing sexual jokes which is not a problem to me as an adult but not good for watching with children this film at times was very crude at times with fart jokes getting hit in the groin etc and for the most part of the film not very funny the premise of the film is that calvin sims who is a inch midget gets out of jail and steals a giant sized diamond but is then forced to put it in a womens handbag so the rest of the movie sees him passing himself off as an abandoned baby getting into this womens house so he can get this diamond back up until now i have enjoyed most of the output from the wayans brothers - but this film is certainly taking the biscuit a bit of good advice - wait till it comes on tv or cable	NEG
first of all yes i m white so i try to tread lightly in the ever delicate subject of race anyway white people hating black people = bad but black people hating white people = ok because apparently we deserved it where do i start i wish i had something good to say about this movie aside unintended comedy scenes: the infamous scene were ice cube and co get in a fight with some really big really strong really really angry and scary looking neo-nazis and win the neo-nazi where twice the size : and the chase the chase is priceless this is not a movie about race tolerance and understanding it doesn t deliver this is a racist movie that re-affirm all the cliché stereotypes the white wimpy guy who gets manhandled by his black roommate automatically transform in a skinhead cmon simply awful i do regret ever seeing it save your time and the dreadful experience of a poorly written poorly acted dull and clearly biased picture if you are into the subject go and rent american history x now thats a movie	NEG
humphrey bogart clearly did not want to be in this film and be forced to play a part-mexican or he would have been suspended believe me he made the wrong choice presumably after the success of dodge city warners tried a follow-up with errol flynn and his usual list of buddies like alan hale guinn big boy williams frank mc hugh and the ever-present john litel but they made the huge mistake of trying to present miriam hopkins as a love interest for flynn v randolph scott and as a singer to really make things bad because she proved one thing and that is she cannot sing the story was not too bad but with bogie clearly miscast also it turned out to be a poor western that was overlong and on a low budget but in fairness color would not have helped 	NEG
the rookie suffers from so much there are the random musical songs interspersed through the movie the long pointless script and enough grating slapstick to make jerry lewis blush noonan and leavitt just don t know when to quit it takes a full hour before the story finally gets to the main plot and the characters are shipwrecked then the guys start playing japanese sailors with the standard racist caricature of the day it is a shame the funniest parts of the movie are when noonan and leavitt are playing the stupid stereotyped japanese guys but it gets pretty tiring after switching back and forth between two sets of characters then it just abruptly ends even a naked julie newmar in a towel can t save this one there is really little charm in the movie and it is over a half hour too long the story just flounders along trying to set up funny situations and failing stick to martin & lewis at least deano had charm and jerry had that animated face 	NEG
first of all this movie isn t a complete disaster if you had never heard of the real story of gram parsons then it might seem a reasonably entertaining diversion johnny knoxville can t really be criticised for his performance as phil kaufman - he s pretty good at looking laid-back and down to earth and you can sort of root for his long-suffering everyman michael shannon is due credit for pretty much the same reasons except he s a hippy stoner there are some good individual comedic scenes - the hippy-hearse crashing into the airport hanger door stands out but that s where the good things end and we begin to see the aspects that make this movie so truly disappointing the character of robert forster as gram s actual father is an invention so disgraceful as to cast a taint over the entire film we all know his real father committed suicide when he was young - something that could surely be compared to gram s life on the edge by a better film-maker having forster as his supposed real father and not his step-father would be bad enough if not for the well known difficulties gram had with the man who actually flew to collect his body it has been suggested that his step father had admitted to providing gram s mother with alcohol as she lay dying and that this enraged gram when he later found out about it also the controversy over where gram s body was buried would surely be reason enough not to invent a benevolent made-up father who actually catches up to the duo and their hearse but then allows them to go ahead with the burning whatever the truth about the man who gram got the name parsons from he certainly bore no resemblance to forster s character here and it is hard to see why this role was written then there s the addition of christina applegate as a greedy chick yet very pretty of course who wants gram s body back so that she can begin to cash in on his estate her character and her acting are non-existent and one wonders why the director didn t just go the whole hog and include a lesbo scene between her and the chick who plays kaufman s girlfriend it wouldn t have lowered the tone a whole lot more when you think of the ingredients that could have been used in a good movie about parsons the shortcomings of this film are easily apparent country music being changed by a young polite southern gentleman - who was also long haired drug loving popular with the ladies and ultimately self destructive real events like the hanger door crash and the painted hearse and friends like keith richards instead of these things we have to concentrate wholly on kaufman s input into gram s life kaufman is obviously still lapping up the cult status he received for what he did he certainly is a little cult from interviews it is obvious that he s delighted with the attention remember this is the man who made a remark about the genitalia of the naked corpse of gram parsons as he was preparing to set it alight what he did was not an act of great loyalty but a doped up alcoholic escapade looking at knoxville and the director in interviews a few things become clear also it s obvious that they have no real grasp of the story of gram s life nor do they wish to have they want a hit movie about an event that is infamous and crazy it was an amazing life with a strange end that the end is the only thing covered by this movie shows how limited an understanding of gram parsons the makers had 	NEG
my teacher taped this and showed it to us in child care to demonstrate how teen pregnancy affects people it just demonstrated how teen pregnancy affects a childish jock not properly educated on how sex works and a whiny unloved girl who throws fruit when angry and couldn t tell she was with the wrong man even if he wore a sign stating he was such i wouldn t be surprised if the father of the baby had about eight girlfriends in the first edition of the script stacy s the carrier of the baby mother is a riot she is oblivious to the fact her daughter is past the age of four and is seemingly unshaken when people spy on her through her dining room window bobby s the father best friend s name is dewey and is an obvious rip off of sean penn s character in fast times at ridgemont high this movie is horrid simply because none of the characters are believable thank goodness it s only made for tv limiting the public s chances of viewing it 	NEG
any movie that has nude scenes of karen allen and i m still so bored i walk out that is a stinker karen gets stuck in paris and befriends a sissily-handsome french man with whom she is having sex soon of course he s married but cheri why should that be a problem what could be an interesting clash of cultures is believe it or not just dull i walked out maybe the movie got a lot better after i left; but it would have had to have gotten a lot better to make up for a rotten beginning my advice if you find yourself in this run do not walk for the exit save your time and your energy most assuredly save your money it s a shame the production company didn t save its money 	NEG
witty quirky genuine surreal butterfly wings one could ask what all of these words best describe and some those in fuse with the international film community may quickly say happenstance but others may jump aboard the more american train and immediately yell the butterfly effect strangely i would be one of those screaming for that sci-fi kutcher film mainly because none of those words that i initially mentioned at the start of this paragraph accurately depicts the tautou feature that i witnessed sure we all loved her in amelie and thought she was the daughter of jesus in the da vinci code but in this film first-time director of a feature film at least laurent firode doesn t give tautou the opportunity to shine sadly he gives nobody the opportunity to really demonstrate themselves because he is too delicately caught up in the moments of random chance to bring this film to anything but just a shimmer never a true boil firode has ample and i use ample as a small word moments throughout this film where he could have built us a fantastical story a genuinely whimsical fairy-tale of love and coincidence but instead he fell face-first into a mud-bucket of chaotic intertwining that overwhelmed us with inconsistent characters and a story that left us gasping for less tautou s beautiful face adorns the cover of this box but do not be so taken immediately as i did in assuming that this was going to be another monumental journey into tautou s french cinema tautou is in this film do not get me wrong but one could argue that she is not at the center of this story firode s job is to create a series of random events that eventually will lead to an audience friendly albeit confusing ending which exemplifies that meaning of refreshing melodrama he utterly utterly fails firode fails by giving us the audience too many characters with too many characters he gives us too many random interventions and by the end you don t really care who is who or what is what or how is how; your main focus happens to be centered solely on the ending credits and the time destination of their arrival tautou could have saved this film from the disaster it was if only firode would have given her the center alas he did not but attempted to seemingly force a group of through a theoretical film hole about the size of a penny it just didn t work and we were left with a jam in which we were completely stuck firode fails because he focus so intently on the minor details that for one of those rare film occurrences he actually forgets the central focus i can say that there was no defined central focus to happenstance in the beginning he attempts to create one with our two supposed main characters discovering that they share the same birthday and their horoscope promises love by the moonlight but we never go back to that throughout the film instead again we are bombarded with new characters stuffy scenes and meaningless drivel obviously chosen to direct us away from an actual story and more into a world full of ifs ands and buts i couldn t do it i couldn t believe this film writer firode yes the same guy directing this garbage uses a technique so primitive in this film that i immediately felt like ending it immediately he must have been assuming that many of us were incapable of actually following the storyline or the scientific premise because he grabs the aid of a homeless person to actually fill in the respective blanks i didn t need this nor do i think firode needed to belittle his audience in this matter while there were other elements that just didn t seem to work for me at all again felt like a jumbled parisian collage of shredded paper this was the icing on the cake i don t need my hand held through films i will give this film one star for credit this is a rather difficult genre to master successfully time travel films are especially hard because of the innumerable amounts of possibilities that are never accounted for but with happenstance it works because firode semi-explores the different avenues while i will counter with saying that he does not do it well it did make for at least five full minutes of enjoyment i liked where firode was headed with this film he had a genuinely diagramed story but the final execution just blew this film to shreds firode could have saved this film if he would have strengthened his characters while lightening up his premise and story i think my overall mood of this film would have changed if just these two simple directions were taken oh how i only wish i could time travel back to the production of this film to show firode the errors of his ways overall for the first time and probably last this was a tautou film that i must say utterly disappointed me from the choppy opening to the apathetic ending i just felt that happenstance failed due to firode s leadership and horrid marketing marketing is something that i didn t mention before but why would anyone purchase this film thinking that it was an amelie per the title released in hong kong and why would you place tautou squarely on the cover knowing full well that she wasn t carrying this film at all i believe that from the first minute that passed on my dvd player this film was in shambles while i will applaud his subject everything else was well below the level of mediocrity i cannot suggest this film to anyone grade: out of 	NEG
i am so appalled by this documentary i am deeply embarrassed and ashamed by the way puertoricans were portrayed this documentary was not about the culture of puertoricans it was about the culture of nuyoricans puertoricans and nuyoricans are two different cultures very different cultures and should not be generalized to the puerto rican population rosie before you make a documentary you need to do the research you also need to check and make sure your sources are credible puerto ricans are not all loud and they do have class which is one thing the documentary lacked to show when i saw rosie and jimmie on the view and rosie on martha stewart i was very excited about watching i even made sure to let my parents know since they love puerto rico so much after the first five minutes i could not believe how the documentary bashed the us and made puerto ricans look like a bunch of guinea pigs you need to go and visit puerto rico and you will see that puerto rico is not a rd world country where more than % of the population is in poverty puerto rico has colleges and well known universities roads cars shopping centers malls the largest kmart and jcpenney s i ve ever seen restaurants theaters beaches hotels ritz hilton etc casinos churches agriculture auto expresso and restaurants just to name a few poverty not % of the population is puerto rican culture is about family music food celebrating and trying to move forward not backward oh and new cousins don t just pop up out of no where no that is not a puerto rican thing that is a ghetto thing we are not bastards parents of puertorican descent who would like to teach their children about puerto rico should invest in a trip with the family so they can see first hand what puerto rico is all about they will see its beauty people and culture please don t show them this documentary because it will only cloud their minds with negativity oh and please don t tell your american friends to watch this documentary because it will only make the puertorican people look ignorant yes i am born and raised puerto rican from the island just so you know 	NEG
while flipping through the channels on a late saturday night my friends and i stumbled across this film first of all irish actor pierce brosnan as a native american seriously his accent was breaking through so much although his character was apparently scottish next i was stunned to find that this film was made after he had already played james bond agent at least twice this movie plays up the stereotypes with the inspiring professor figure the girl who played pony should be paid to keep her mouth shut and this film won an award i cannot believe it brosnan is an attractive man but we seriously wanted to gauge our eyes out after watching this for just seconds we switched from kicking and screaming to this and we wanted to switch back we watched the children s classic the indian in the cupboard earlier in the night which also discussed the iroquois the following line represents our desire to run away: take me outside earth grasper from grey owl : if you don t like it you don t have to watch 	NEG
billy chung siu hung s the bloody swordplay film assassin from film love to kill hong kong is among the strongest products of the category iii boom that inhabited the hk cinema in early nineties it consisted of films with strong sex nudity and violence more or less gratuitous and shock valued only love to kill definitely belongs to the more category with some unforgettable ideas and pieces of celluloid sickness the hk psycho anthony wong from the award winning the untold story by herman yau from the same year plays a business man and a husband who likes to torture humiliate and rape his young wife elizabeth lee mei fung who for some reason doesn t leave him and save herself and their little son from the disturbed tormentor a policeman danny lee the famous police character actor from films like dr lamb by billy tang and co-directed by lee and the killer by john woo to name just a few however sees the problem and starts to protect the wife and the son but anthony naturally doesn t like this at all and leads it all into the typical ultra-mean spirited and graphic finale during a rain storm the film is almost completely without any serious merits as it s just a piece of exploitation in order to cash in when these kind of films were so popular the imagery and happenings are something never found in the western cinema at least in mainstream and it all becomes even more mind-blowing when some most taboos for westerners like violence and perversions witnessed by a child are broken in these films so often that reading the plotlines alone would make most viewers feel sick and that goes perfectly especially for this film too the film still has a rather interesting and creepy soundtrack in the tradition of the mentioned dr lamb which practically started the whole boom in usually the music and soundtrack in hk films is interesting and adds to the imagery especially in these terror films also the cinematography is worth mentioning as the film bathes especially in the finale in blue colors and camera lenses as does assassin too and the raging storm is captured nicely on the camera otherwise there s nothing that would rate the film any higher other than on the nastiness-meter the actors and actresses are talented and professional and so don t make the film any worse with their acting still the film has the usual hk humor in it which makes the sick goings-on even sicker as some humor is thrown into the soup that includes some jokes about danny lee s erection and so on something that could never be found in the western serious films either and that thing usually destroys mane otherwise noteworthy hk films as the humor is just so obvious way and attempt to entertain the audience and masses the film has a very high outrageousness level as it has numerous scenes depicting the abuse of wong s wife in various ways she gets raped and molested beaten and kicked by her husband we also get to see some flashbacks from wong s own childhood which turns out to be equally violent as his own father killed too and turned his young son into what he is now these flashback scenes mostly at the end of the film include also some totally unexpected experiences as the imagery is speeded up for example the hits of an axe and that creates completely insane and mean spirited atmosphere to the scene again something that only hk exploitation makers seem to be able to come up with the ending itself includes plenty of sudden and shocking gore as the madman wields his axe and meets also some nails for example on his furious way the film is also genuinely pretty suspicious in my opinion as the violence and terror is realistically painful and deals with things that should never be taken as entertainment mostly i mean rape the version i saw i ve seen two versions includes a very long and completely nauseating rape scene that just tries to be as sadistic as possible i m not sure does the hk audience really like imagery like this but i think no one with some sense for morality in films entertainment would never accept or make something like it women get brutalized and killed in the most sadistic and low ways so that the fates of the men seem almost tame when compared to the females the other version i saw the newly released dvd in hk without subtitles has this table brutality scene in a much longer form than the subtitled taiwanese dvd which is otherwise identical to the hk version i ve also heard that the old hk laserdisc is different from these two and since the end credits are filled with scenes and images not found in the actual film it is impossible to say how uncut versions these that have been released or shown theatrically are obviously plenty of footage has been cut out possibly even before the theatrical release the film is written by law gam fai and lau wing kin the former having written also films like dr lamb the untold story and gunmen kirk wong but out of his other films that i ve seen love to kill is the most gratuitous dr lamb and the untold story both are very brutal and violent but have also some attempt to some criticism towards the authorities and men in general as how it is easy to turn into a beast when chasing or fighting one the harrowing torture imagery of the untold story the victim being the criminal is very strong and definitely has its impact to change something that may be rotten in the society and among the police for example but there s none of this in love to kill it is just honest calculated and fastly made exploitation which is by the way produced by a veteran director kirk organized crime & triad bureau crime story wong love to kill earns no more than from me as i don t have too high appreciation on films like this hk cinema is meant to be and can be more and films like love to kill are only commercial parasites living among the real pieces of the art 	NEG
thhe is entertaining in that you ll laugh a lot and cringe and probably say oh sh t and get your face away from the goddamn hole you dumb s or things along those lines but i don t know if its really worth seeing- i was very annoyed throughout the entirety with the horrible military characters who don t seem to know the first thing about combat yes there was more violence gore and a higher body count than the first one but i am still am debating whether that cancels out my feeling throughout the whole movie about how ridiculous it is and not a good ridiculousness like dead alive or feast my time would have been better spent watching aja s remake for the th time so go for some laughs or go for some gore but don t go hoping to come out of it satisfied 	NEG
an interesting idea for a film both showing the last dragon on earth and showing the struggle he and someone evil have together when he was younger einon got stabbed in the heart so bowen dennis quaid took him to the dark lord who gave him half his heart now grown up einon david thewlis is now the selfish and evil king meanwhile bowen is using a new friend draco the dragon voiced by sir sean connery to get rewards for killing dragons but because einon has half of draco s hear they both feel the pain in one of them is hurt or killed also starring pete postlethwaite as gilbert of glockenspur jason isaacs as lord felton julie christie as queen aislinn and john gielgud as king arthur it was nominated for the oscar for best visual effects worth watching 	NEG
my first attempt at watching this ended in minutes roughly after the tv report scene which i couldn t handle it went approximately like this:reporter : hmm there s a pyramid in our skies reporter : i think it s aliens awkward silence reporter : in other news a few days later i watched it to the end and it wasn t as horrible as i ve imagined but there are serious problems with this about half of the plot can be easily discarded and the other half should be expanded to explain the background story or something what use are the detective the eugenics people and the monsters which are disposed of momentarily by horus more amusing was the monopoly scene we re all powerful gods who have lived for aeons and of all the games in the multiverse we happen to play monopoly monopoly monopoly even erich von dainiken looks coherent compared to that the other half is terribly lacking what did our protagonist do to get himself cryo-frozen why was there no big event when he was released at the end he had those pesky followers remember what happened to normal humans what s the deal with the masked guy how did the blue-haired girl appear what s with her eyesight etcetera etcetera visually it s ok more or less if you disregard the egyptian gods looking like walking turds with rotweiller heads 	NEG
many people see this as a classic but i obviously must have missed something life in anarene texas in the early s is pretty dull - which means that a movie about life in anarene texas in the early s will be pretty dull too what is it that so many people see in this once the last picture show in anarene closes there really won t be anything to do in town duane jeff bridges makes that point at the end of the movie but even before it closes there isn t much to do so basically everything revolves around sex high school students make plans for how to lose their virginity - sometimes with each other and sometimes with some of the equally bored adults in town you see there s not much for them to do either - except to have sex sometimes with each other and sometimes with the bored teenagers or to whine about the local high school football team three times something happened that i thought was going to add some spark of drama to the movie sam ben johnson dies unexpectedly but nothing really happens because of that sonny timothy bottoms and jacy cybill shepherd elope but nothing really happens because of that joe bob barc doyle kidnaps a little girl but nothing really happens because of that the only thing that added anything of dramatic value to the movie came at the end with the death of billy sam bottoms which really points out the emptiness of life in this pathetic little town as the men stand around looking at the body debating where to go for breakfast peter bogdanovic filmed this in black and white which is intended i suppose to point out how grey this town is but the only thing i found interesting was the early look at actors like bottoms shepherd bridges and randy quaid as an aside it was terrifying to see how much quaid - in - actually looks like his character of cousin eddie in the national lampoon vacation movies classic i don t think so 	NEG
like with any movie genre there are good gangster movies and there are bad gangster movies if you asked me to name a good gangster movie i d have dozens to choose from if you asked me to name a bad gangster movie probably the first one to pop up in my mind is one that still has me in a sort of depression of disappointment about a week since i saw the film for the first and i promise you the last time that film is the general unrelated to the silent film of the same name this is a very dry very slow gangster epic that raises questions not about the story it s more than easy to follow but about why the filmmakers chose to make this rather flimsy endeavor like goodfellas and american gangster two superior mob movies the general is based on real people and true events the film revolves around an irish criminal named martin cahill brendan gleeson who started his long chain of crimes stealing food as a teenager and then moving up to robbing museums and houses as an adult meanwhile the police led by an inspector named kenny jon voight try desperately and vigorously to prove just one of his crimes and convict or kill him perhaps because it s a film in the same category as the marvelous goodfellas and the first two godfather films i was expecting too much from the general but that may be going too easy on it this would have been a bad film had i not seen the aforementioned masterpieces before being swamped by boredom in this oater and its far-too-stretched running time of screaming bad scenes let s start knocking the film by just looking at the style in which it is presented for some reason director john boorman and cinematographer seamus deasy selected to film this movie in black-and-white while its style and presentation are clearly the elements that belong to a full-fledged color film now i have nothing against b w pictures not even ones made in modern-day times schindler s list was more than ninety percent filmed in black-and-white and it s a masterpiece the general made just five years after schindler s list is not the cinematography is also far too blown out with high lighting keys that seem very distracting and give the movie a very video-game-like quality that i found simply annoying the filmmakers were obviously going for a realist s documentary-like style like schindler s list did but they fail by making it seem too much like a documentary and at the same time too much like a classic-style motion picture performances in the film range from passable to poor brendan gleeson and jon voight gave decent enthusiasm for their roles but it seemed to me at times that even they were getting kind of run down by the awful screenplay from which they were quoting the sound design is also very primitive probably in an attempt to give it a s crime-noir appeal but that also fails because again it s made too much like a contemporary picture and seems vastly out of place but the worst thing that occurs is that there s not onenot onecharacter in the film that i felt any emotions or opinions for in fact for every moment of every scene the only thought going through my head was okayso what moments that in a better film might come across as shocking or appalling are just dull and time-consuming here i did not sympathize or hate the brendan gleeson character because the way the cahill character is written is simply flat and dull gleeson just plays the common criminal and does not strike out with the impact the real martin cahill obviously did if a character is killed off as they always are in gangster films we feel nothing no remorse no relief no surprise nothing we just say so what and that s all i did during the entire running time of this very flimsy very poorly-made crime film 	NEG
i figured that any horror film with orson welles in it would be weird necromancy sure was but it was a little too weird for it s own good the film does indeed have a creepy feel as it deals with a coven of satanists witches in a small town and a young woman s attempt to escape them the director though seems to be deliberately trying to confuse the audience by using flashbacks and dream sequences by the finale there are too many unanswered questions what s worse as the story is so confusing it s pretty hard to root for any of the characters it seems odd that welles would agree to headline this film especially since he doesn t have that much to do maybe someday they will put out a tape of the outtakes and bloopers from this movie now that would really be fun 	NEG
first i am not really a fan of the whole things eating flesh in disgusting new ways genre of film but i am a bad movie afficionado so my next door neighbor said he had the worst movie ever this one so we start watching it first and foremost - it is recorded on a camcorder sans tripod second the voice of the skinny white doctor is dubbed by a large black man third none of the dialogue makes any sense fourth the zombie scenes though unconvincing and chockful of poor makeup and tomato paste lead me to believe the director and my next door neighbor are in need of psychological help it s funny for about minutes but it gets old fast it s so amateurish it s like watching a poorly dubbed high school video yearbook with zombies a note to anyone involved with this movie - i want the minutes of my life i spent watching this before i fell asleep back 	NEG
i came to new port south expecting a surrogate movie about the columbine school massacre similar to gus van sant s elephant and certainly the synopsis in the tv guide stating that a student sociopath rebels against the system did give me that impression but this is a very boring movie where little happens so consider yourself warned the story is about maddox a chicago high school student who decides to strike back at what he perceives to be an authoritarian regime the major problem is that the character is underwritten and the actor who plays him blake shields is unable to embellish any script deficiencies you have the gut feeling that maddox should have the evil charisma of hitler saddam or bin laden but he never comes across as anything more than a petulant truculent teenager and it s impossible to believe he could rally any disciples the subtext of you overthrow one manipulative authoritarian regime only to replace it with another manipulative regime is too obvious which means new port south is an entirely unconvincing drama that s not worth going out of your way to see	NEG
before i start i _love_ eddie izzard i think he s one of the funniest stand-ups around today possibly that means i m going into this with too high expectations but i just didn t find eddie funny in this outing i think the main problem is eddie is trying too hard to be eddie everyone knows him as a completely irrelevant comic and we all love him for it but in circle he appears to be going more for irrelevant than funny and completely lost me in places many of the topics he covers he has covered before - i even think i recognised a few recycled jokes in there if you buy the dvd you ll find a behind-the-scenes look at eddie s tour interesting in places but not very funny and a french language version of one of his shows die-hards will enjoy seeing eddie in a different language but subtitled comedy isn t very funny if you re a fan of eddie you ve either got this already or you re going to buy it whatever i say if you re just passing through buy glorious or dressed to kill - you won t be disappointed with circle you probably will 	NEG
this movie starts out with a certain amount of promise; but in my view begins to lose it when the protagonist kidnaps the good samaritan who comes to his aid when his car breaks down that this well-meaning stranger begins to fix his car while he is away making a phone call is implausible enough but that she is one of the few people in the country who can help him put his family s life back on track is the type of coincidence beginning writers are warned against using in their stories i found this movie average at best art direction could have been much better as could have been cinematography the acting was good and so was eva van der gucht s singing 	NEG
before i d seen this i had seen some pretty bad christmas films but once i saw this jingle all the way looked better than the godfather santa claus is a jolly film about santa helping out some kids but it almost feels demonic watching it santa s jolly ho-ho-ho is replaces by an evil devilish laugh that i m sure has turned many kids off of christmas the plot of this massacre is very strange which fits along with all of the performances and dialog santa lives high above earth in the north pole where he and kids from all around the world get ready for christmas but santa has an enemy named pitch or satan pitch tries to ruin santa s christmas by making three boys naughty and by creating diversions like moving the chimney and making the doorknob hot when pitch causes santa to be attacked by a dog it s up to santa s helper pedro and merlin the wizard to get santa out of this pickle everything about this film along with being downright bad is so bizarre satan dances a lot and he actually seems much more merry than santa santa talks about delivering presents to all the boys and girls yet he seems to only deliver to houses of kids in mexico the reindeer are wind up toys and when the reindeer laughs i m amazed it doesn t bring tears to kid s eyes it s frightening everything is terrible the first minutes are simply santa playing the organ while kids sing to it probably one of the strangest scenes is santa shooting pitch in the butt with a mini-cannon and uproariously laughing about it while pitch dances around in pain i think parents are better off telling their little kids about where babies come from than showing them this the only positive is it will have you laughing hysterically if you can appreciate bad cinema my rating: bomb mins 	NEG
there is a really good movie lurking just beneath the surface of the layers upon layers of cheese that is the pagemaster i found this out when i watched this again this morning after neglecting it for years and years i remember hating it with a passion when it first came out but this time i found that the special effects are quite good the plot is just the neverending story with a creativity-endectomy but it s an okay little flick for anyone who just wants some really awesome eye-candy the animation is amazing and i especially liked how the animators let their characters look and act a bit more surrealistic than the norm i m giving it a grade of three as i would have given it a two just for parody value if i had ever decided to watch this movie expecting it to absolutely blow my mind story-wise 	NEG
the plot of the thinner is decidedly thin and gross an obese lawyer drives over the gypsy woman and the gypsy curse causes him to lose and lose weight to the bone ok gypsy curses should be entertaining but the weight-losing gone bad nope except stephen king thinks so and michael mcdowell other horror author and the screenwriter of this abysmal film does so too the lawyer is not only criminally irresponsible he is fat too haha the thinner is like an immature piece of crap for a person who moans how he she has never seen anything so disgusting than fatness hey i can only say: well look at the mirror 	NEG
i recently watched the first guinea pig film the devil s experiment and i must admit to being disappointed this film is invariably included in any list of the nastiest films and maybe i was expecting more because of the hype the truth is though i don t rate it if i d been watching it believing the opening text to be true i found this tape i might have been a bit disturbed by it thinking it was real even without the benefit of knowing it not to be real though i think i d have worked out that it indeed wasn t throughout the film the girl s reactions to what is being done to her just aren t what they should be she should be screaming like a banshee in pain the fact that she isn t means that it s obviously not real i wouldn t want to watch it if it were real but if she were to be more convincing in her acting the film would be more disturbing and then there are the notorious scenes: nothing affected me at all up until the scalpel in the hand the hot oil maggots and innards just didn t bother me i m not saying i m hard ; just that i wasn t able to suspend my disbelief partly because of the girl s inaction the scalpel made me wince a little but the hammer to the hand just made the hand look rubber and the final scene with the eye was again a little wincing but nothing more i didn t want to look away and neither did i feel nauseous perhaps it s because the film is twenty-odd years old or perhaps i m just jaded the truth is i didn t find this film at all disturbing it s the kind of thing you might expect to see playing on a loop as a modern art installation and as an exercise in stripping away characters story etc and just leaving the torture it works on some levels as a disturbing piece of film though it didn t work for me at least i watched guinea pig with my wife who is of the it s just a film bent and she wondered what all the fuss was about we got to discussing why i watch these films and my reasons are many but include a desire to be affected by a film she said that she didn t think any film could be so convincing as to disturb her and challenged me to do exactly that i played her the fire extinguisher scene from irreversible and she was indeed disturbed i m not sure i have a point other than that both of us were more disturbed by a scene in a non-horror genre film than any film thus far which sets out to disturb 	NEG
it is not obvious from viewing this film so i recommend viewers research the people who present their case in it but this presentation on the realities of islam and its encouragement of violence and intolerance against all non-muslims is lacking objectiveness and also completely fails to factor in the human condition it is one thing to document that the koran says many things about how a devout muslim is required to interact with non-muslims but any realist is able to realize that not every human who feels himself or herself to be a follower of islam will agree with and comply with all tenets of that faith and system there is reason to call much about the presenters into question such that viewers need to see the presentation with a healthy skepticism; don t swallow it all hook line and sinker without some thinking of your own one specific for instance is researching the person walid shoebat; who claims to be a former muslim who perpetrated an act of terrorism in bethlehem there are many wise people in the world who believe neither of these assertions i am not nor have i ever been a muslim i have never read the koran i am not a christian nor a member of _any_ faith but i am an intelligent and discerning human while the film is quite disturbing in its presentation of how some muslims view their obligation to islam; i remind you that there is more to islam than the views of the fundamentalists just as their are fundamentalists and evangelical christians so too there are variations in the intensity of belief and obligation among jews and muslims when you watch this film you need to have the salt shaker on hand one grain will not be enough you ll need more please use your own mind and think for yourself research what is presented and evaluate the state of the world and how islam fits within it based on more than what is said in minutes of video there is a common thread of political affiliation among those who put this film together indicating a definite bias be your own brain 	NEG
i honestly believe that anyone considering film-making be subjected to this mind-boggling failure like the films of edward wood jr in the s and s this film is a shining example of why real filmmakers expend so much energy rewriting scripts re-editing their films and reworking their special effects until they finally look right this movie is also a decent argument for the studios pre-screening process if mr hines were forced to endure the honest reactions of an impartial audience perhaps he would have cut % or the walking running strolling scenes and edited this movie down to a more bearable minutes film students should view this movie as an example of just how dangerous thinking their work is good enough can truly be every performance every line of dialog every digital effect every filter effect indeed every frame of video expresses the danger of striving for mere mediocrity a beginning filmmaker may find himself herself tempted from time to time to think at least i accomplished something or just finishing this will be an accomplishment in itself this movie will help them understand just how badly a film can turn out critics might also benefit from seeing this movie before they dub the latest summer entertainment the worst movie ever made beginning writers can learn from this film just how important rewrites are and perhaps understand the necessity for rewrites also beginning directors can learn the importance of a good screenplay and some degree of respect for just how hard it is to write a script that causes the audience to feel emotionally compelled through the story writers and directors who watch bad made-for-cable movies of the week and think i can do better than that can see get an idea from this movie how difficult it really is to produce even mediocre results i sincerely believe this movie can serve as an educational tool to beginning filmmakers particularly those entering the craft in this current post-lucas and post-spielberg environment there is a reason filmmakers such as these are hailed for their ability with special effects the war of the worlds illustrates clearly that not everyone can pull it off some can t even come close to it 	NEG
the guy did a lot of title design for a bunch of movies and i guess one day he said; i should pick a cheap scenario try to put as much title in it as a can cause after all i m a title designer and try to persuade people that this is in fact a movie one of the worst i ve even seen that s for sure if you fell the urge to see nice titles go check out some posters don t waste your time watching this it kinda ironic don t you think did you saw the poster the only part of his project that should had title work done have almost none 	NEG
i m glad that i saw this film after mr sandler became famous it is bad bad bad bad there is no plot it s like watching a painfully dull home movie i really enjoy his other films but if you re a fan like me stay away from this one it may change your thoughts on adam you may never recover from the horror that is this film i ve had a better time watching old folks play scrabble in a home 	NEG
i completely agree with the other comment someone should do a what s up tiger lily with this film it has to be one of the worst french films i ve seen in a long time actually along with brotherwood of the wolves horrendous films in a much too short period of time it s really sad because the cast is really interesting and the original idea kind of fun antoine decaunes in particular and jean rochefort being among my darlings i was bitterly disappointed to see them compromised in such a poor film lou doyon is quite bad as usual which goes to prove that a pretty face and famous parents can get you into the movies but they don t necessarily give you talent avoid this film if you want to laugh watch an alain chabat instead or some nice period piece full of fun like la fille de d artagnan 	NEG
this movie is awful i don t even know where to begin i m speechless i can t even describe how awful this is the blood is flourescent first of all and the acting is awful the only good part was the biker chick that saves the day this movie was rediculous i don t see how it could even get a vote of its so bad it looks like it was made by highschool students 	NEG
if you want to watch a real quality movie get hold of the eden formula this wondrous film must have cost all of $ to make it features a wafer thin script pathetically bad sets lighting and camera work and a stop motion paper-mache monster that is utterly laughable it looks like they sometimes used a guy in a rubber suit and or a glove puppet for the monster - but all were equally dreadful the actors all speak their lines as though they ve never seen them before and are reading off a teleprompter the special effects are way beyond lousy and the only sad thing is that they dropped the really nifty original title tyranasaurus wrecks which sums up exactly what you get for the full minutes this is what happens when you scrape the bottom of the barrel so hard you break through to the crud that lies underneath i loved every minute of it 	NEG
superhero movies pretty much always suck and this is no exception its only redeeming quality is the fact the movie could have been even worse i would put batman & robin and steel above this movie so yes it is that bad if your looking for a black superhero check out blankman its not a serious superhero movie but at least its entertaining 	NEG
thomas archer ron eldard has his child killed and his wife viciously attacked in a home invasion dr heller christopher plummer tries to help him through the post traumatic stress then archer finds himself confronted with a man til schweiger bound and gagged to a chair he is told this is the man who killed his child and attacked his wife and he can do whatever he likes to him and there s a large assortment of instruments there to help him film is interesting at first and shows real restraint in terms of blood and gore but gets stupider by the minute and has some highly unlikely plot twists and turns it all ends in a final twist that was so old and stupid that i was shocked anyone would actually think of using it anymore how such talented actors like eldard schweiger and plummer got involved in crap like this is beyond me this gets three stars for the acting but the stupid plot and truly unbelievable twists make this a chore to sit through 	NEG
it s hard to praise this film much the cgi for the dragon was well done but lacked proper modelling for light and shadow also the same footage is used endlessly of the dragon stomping through corridors which becomes slightly tedious i was amazed to see marcus aurelius in the acting credits wondering what an ex-emperor of the roman empire was doing acting in this film like whoopie goldberg it must be an alias and can one blame him for using one if he appears in this stinker the story might been interesting but the acting is flat and direction is tedious if you must watch this film go around to your friend s house and get drunk while doing so - then it ll be enjoyable 	NEG
there have been more interesting polish documentaries on worm farming in brail_ the competition worm farming had a better plot and more interesting characters i was physically ill after watching this movie the cheating husband i think dougray_scott_ was a joke in every meaning of the word poor jennifer must really need the work and what was with the accent the locations and random meetings reminded me of a high school prank and showed the humility of a year old in cooking class it was that bad that i think i will write the sequel named this is not a laxitive thank you for listening it was a great weight of my conscious 	NEG
man to man tries hard to be a good movie: it has its heart at the right place it aspires to be epic and it has a message that no doubt everybody will appreciate but there lies also some of the problems of this picture it strives so hard to be good and to get its message across that sometimes the viewer must feel unchallenged so it is only adequate that the images which are used by this picture are simplistic - man to man doesn t let the viewer decide what he thinks is right but is hammering its message in his head joseph fiennes exemplifies this in his role: he does his best to look concerned genuinely moved and all the other emotions you can express with the single one facial expression his repertoire has to offer add that the movie is overlong and loses its speed towards the end you would be easily led to the conclusion that man to man is not worth watching but there are enough points to defend it: it is entertaining has some humorous scenes and the show-stealing kristin scott thomas of course you should not compare it to humanistic masterpieces like the elephant man david lynch but you ll be leaving the theatre satisfied it tries to grab your heart even if your brain thinks that it is too obvious and succeeds most of the time 	NEG
tom wolfe s sprawling brilliantly observed satiric novel of life among new york snobbery gets a glossy look here but is nevertheless not well served the film suffers not merely from the miscasting of everyman tom hanks as an uncaring yuppie kewpie-doll melanie griffith as a manipulative southern belle and bruce willis as the darling of new york s literati the most serious miscasting was in the director s chair robert altman might have breathed life into these unlikeable characters and made them interesting but brian de palma for all of his visual sophistication has never had an eye for the nuances of the human experience the resulting film looks good but seems blah toward its subject of dehumanization in favor of status honestly if a satire does not make the viewer angry what is the point 	NEG
this movie is about tyrannus a gladiator who is brought back from the dead to summon tyrannus a gladiator who must be brought back from the dead tyrannus we learn after about an hour is also called demonicus this adds much needed depth to the screenplay and calls into question our assumptions about identity psychology and ourselves the spirit of tyrannus accomplishes his little to-do list killing some people and saying repetitive phrases in latin by possessing the body of a college guy he uses a magic mind-control helmet to do this which the college boy willingly puts on his head and then at several points in the movie takes off and puts back on maria performs oral sex on a poor man s sean willian scott and tyrannus wears the rollerball glove tyrannus has his own green backlighting for no reason and has apparently been sitting next to cg fire in an ancient concrete tunnel for centuries like this utter misfortune this movie is empty and will hurt you see it 	NEG
a good idea badly implemented while that could summarize % of the scifi channel s movies it really applies here i love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed and i like action movies and i like all of the main actors so this could have been great however despite some good acting this movie fails due to bill platt s bad writing and directing another review made the good point of needing to know where you re going so you can get there this movie doesn t it s put together in such a haphazard way that you know the words second draft are not in bill platt s vocabulary there is one scene that is entirely unnecessary and could be removed without anyone noticing this scene even begins and ends with them driving a car so you could cut from one car scene to the other and never have missed the pointless scene in the middle this movie also had a strange habit of under explaining some details while over explaining others some to the point where you can guess the entire plot up front it also had a habit of aborting a fight early probably just because they couldn t afford it there are also a few laughably bad scenes where the plot is revealed on a computer and the final battle involving conveniently placed toxic adhesive seriously what is that if you are a fan of shiri appleby watch this movie because she s ok she does manage to break out of her roswell persona a few times and make for a good tough chick but not always john de lancie plays the same character he plays in everything he s ever done since playing q back in st:tng so that s nothing new in all i gave this movie a rating 	NEG
some movies are repellent but still fascinating pulp fiction ; others are simply boring this movie has an almost unique feature of being both utterly repellent and totally boring by the end i didn t care about any of the characters i just wanted all of them dead so i could get out of the theatre 	NEG
this show comes up with interesting locations as fast as the travel channel it is billed as reality but in actuality it is pure prime time soap opera it s tries to use exotic locales as a facade to bring people into a phony contest & then proceeds to hook viewers on the contestants soap opera style it also borrows from an early cbs game show pioneer- beat the clock- by inventing situations for its contestants to try & overcome then it rewards the winner money if they can spice it up with a little interaction between the characters even better while the game format is in slow motion versus beat the clock- the real accomplishment of this series is to escape reality this show has elements of several types of successful past programs reality television hardly but if your hooked on the contestants locale or contest this is your cup of tea if your not this entire series is as i say drivel dripping with gravy it is another show hiding behind the reality label which is the trend it started in it is slick & well produced so it might last a while yet after all so do re-runs of gilligan s island green acres the beverly hillbillies & the brady bunch this just doesn t employ professional actors the intelligence level is about the same 	NEG
ok so i rented this clown-like-chainsaw-massacre-esquire film not expected much but i did like the novel approach to a serial killer film from the back of the box is the following synopsis at first it was just a joke - a myth around the campfire - for five friends staying at a remote cabin in the texas woods but when they began to disappear one-by-one replaced by scattered bloodied body parts and voodoo effigies the remaining few scramble for their lives but he s out there and he s sick and all he wants is blood so obviously from the get-go it doesn t make sense: why is this clown in the woods to begin with why a clown why are their dolls with the word food drawn on them why why why hardly anything gets answered in this hour min bore fest except where this clown lives the characters are dumb guys dumb girls and a hell of a lot of bitchiness one in particular is a girl whom they brought from a restaurant up the road whom they thought they should help because she was getting hassled by some guy she knew what warrants that as an excuse to bring a girl into your circle of friends or their cabin she of course begins planting seeds of jealousy having the men have sex with her by feeding their dumb minds everything they want to hear the music was an average affair standard frantic keyboard music like in every horror film without differences the actors seemed to be brought from some soap opera the way they complained and whined about everything the idea that the main guy in the film takes this girl to the cabin as their first date makes for a horrible date but of course she unrealistically gives herself to him on the first night of getting to know him there was hardly a budget spent of anything it seems but there was a clown outfit and plenty of cheap $ -store dolls lying around in the woods which was a horribly bland place to shoot this whole movie been done too many times i was also waiting for the clown to jump into the house to kill the remaining characters of the film in through the glass maybe but nothing exciting like that ever entered the film i guess you were just supposed to like the clown being a killer or something i had to give the film a it was an interesting premise clown as the texas chainsaw massacre character essentially and i ll give them a star for acting serious all the way through when the movie could ve totally been a b-movie-style video but they opted for the more legitimate style of video but ultimately i probably would ve felt like renting the killer klowns from mars video again before going back to check this out ah but that cover art pretty awesome drawing 	NEG
the acting is good the women are beautiful and the men are handsome so if you re looking for well-acted soft porn this movie is for you otherwise you are wasting your time the motivation of the main characters in particular the eponymous lead is often a mystery she could have just told the truth - the truth as presented in the film not necessarily the historical truth - and her lover would have been spared time in jail for a rape he did not commit was she protecting her father who went off half-cocked as it were when he impetuously instigated a malicious lawsuit was she protecting herself with her reputation suddenly of concern when heretofore only her art seemed to matter during the trial this strong-willed woman turns to mush before our eyes conversely her lover who starts off as a narcissistic jerk becomes a selfless hero during the trial at least his motivation is clearer: he sacrifices himself for love naturally since no good deed must go unpunished we are told that she never sees him again 	NEG
oh dear oh dear i started watching this not knowing what to expect i couldn t believe what i was seeing there were times when i thought it was a comedy i loved how the government s plan to capture the terrorist leader is to air drop in one man who is unarmed and expect him to capture him and escape with a rocket pack if only it were really that easy i ve finally found a movie worse than plan from outer space 	NEG
positively awful george sanders vehicle where he goes from being a thief to police czar while sanders was an excellent character actor he was certainly no leading man and this film proves it it is absolutely beyond stupidity gene lockhart did provide some comic relief until a moment of anger led him to fire his gun with tragedy resulting sadly george sanders and co-star carol landis committed suicide in real life after making a film as deplorable as this it is not shocking the usual appealing signe hasso is really nothing here 	NEG
i saw chan is missing when it first came out about four years after moving from san francisco to new york maybe it was the perspective of a few years away but this movie seemed to capture the essence of the city and its people better than anything else i d ever seen still does it concentrates on one particular community - the chinese - but that s fine because so much of the city s soul is refracted through the settings the faces and the maybe above all the voices of the characters this isn t the tourists san francisco the settings are humble and everyday: a taxi cab the kitchen of a chinese restaurant richmond district row houses little chinatown apartments and small-business offices the piers a philippine elder center this is what the city looks and feels like day to day to the people who live there - even now in the era of silicon gulch urban redevelopment unlike say dirty harry in its own way an excellent san francisco movie as well everything is filmed at street level: we come to understand the characters points of view from the perspective their surroundings give them not from some fancy vertiginous shooting wang apparently filmed in b&w because he didn t have the money to do otherwise yet one of the strongest visual elements of the movie is the natural light he achieves the often harsh pervasive quality of the sunlight is one of my closest associations with san francisco: it seems to expose everything bringing the buildings the hills the other landmarks down in scale and in a funny way making the people you pass on the streets seem more individual and potentially closer to you than they might in another place wang s photography perfectly conveys this and even helps the story along at points wang captures the speech and conversational style of chinese and other san franciscans better than anyone ever has i think if there s such thing as a true san francisco accent it s what you hear from the balding taxi medallion broker i think who appears talking on the phone in one scene listen to the way he calls the person on the other end ya dingaling the story is poignant and despite a few very small missteps makes its points beautifully about the longings that pull at the hearts of people living in old immigrant communities - including the justified political and ethnic resentments and little ironic amusements that help to fuel them all this is communicated delicately - perhaps why some respondents here think the film meanders it doesn t - suffice it to say that the two cab drivers quest for chan becomes a quest for something more personal chan is missing finishes up with a chinatown travelogue sequence backed by a goofy novelty song from the s i guess about san francisco and all its crazy diversity an american caricature yes but somehow not entirely off the mark either 	NEG
horror fans i m speaking to the over s although if you re under i apologise for what you might deem an insult : in short if you appreciate having your imagination disturbed by well written original storytelling punctuated by unpredictable well planted scares and delivered via convincing performances then i can heartily recommend - avoiding these steamers - made by directors who have apparently long since past their sell by date it s no accident that almost every episode feels as if it were made in the s not to put blame squarely on the shoulders of some of these old boys or indeed the s because where would we be without certain movies from the likes of argento carpenter landis dante and barker actually clive wtf are you doing in there glad to see romero had the good sense to give it a miss as i m sure he was asked to partake more perhaps we should point the finger at creator mick garris whose credentials include the logic defying and depressingly ill-advised tv remake of stanley kubrick s masterpiece the shining perhaps it is an indication of the state of television today are we so starved of good tv horror that we applaud any old sloppy schlock that the networks excrete onto our sets sadly maybe so normally i wouldn t see the point of adding a comment that doesn t argue the faults and merits of a production i d just rate it accordingly however as this series is woefully lacking in any merit with perhaps the sole exception of the theme tune i write this as more of a warning than a review: don t waste your time and money if you disagree with me then it s more than likely that you haven t seen enough decent horror perhaps the earlier films of some of these directors would be a much better place to start but if these masters of horror were being assessed on these works alone they d never have been allowed to graduate with even their bachelor s degree unless of course they were studying for a degree from the university of s t 	NEG
if is the cinematic equivalent of sgt pepper s: revered by baby boomers as the pinnacle of creation and viewed as rather a silly bit of business by preceding and subsequent generations now that the children of the middle classes the world over are seemingly super human due to the internet and view the prospect of boarding school as a wonderful opportunity thanks to the harry potter books films the relevance of if couldn t be further from modern concern in fact many scenes appear so alien and exaggerated as to hint at an inspiration for pink floyd s the wall one should never hold personal bias against a film while reviewing and the cemented date of this film aside there are a few flaws which others have overlooked lindsay anderson was known to be a fan of luis buñuel on top of generally being too smart for his own good and despite a straightforward narrative through the first and second acts the latter portion of the piece it taken hostage by cod buñuel surrealism and strained attempts at symbolism anderson wasn t capable of this feat due to his over-intelligent cynicism failing to see that buñuel was jovial in his work i have not found a critic whom champions the chaplain in a drawer and am almost certain it still gets sideways looks from those who adore this film the ending is not so much a concise punch to the established class values system as a wet slap on a moving target the british public school system was firmly for the middle classes the upper crust being educated at home by private tutors and the modus operandi of if was to check the boxes of public school life which lindsay believed had been unexplored in film thereby savaging middle class pretense homosexuality generational cutlery cold showers et al in reality such issues had been covered in many other great british films if merely brought them to the fore the browning version was a more oblique damning of such pomp to name but one if is oddly quaint and simply can not be viewed with modern especially american eyes kudos to anderson for avoiding mick and kieth in favour of african chant and a few brownie points for the latent homoerotic overtones points deducted for pretension establishing characters who disappear and inciting a glib revolution which came to naught 	NEG
i knew that evening was a girlie film so i was expecting to be bored a wicked tease on imdb had said that it was a chick flick but that your companion would survive survive yes i am still here but when the two of us came out we were amazed to find that it had only lasted two hours - it seemed a much longer evening than that i suppose that for yanks it is supposed to be elevating or fascinating because it is about rich people living on the beach - well next to the beach in a house with a wide verandah and a lawn but no apparent lawnmower if that sort of thing impresses you it might seem quite a short film there s a monty python film about a knight who just won t die he ends up a wriggling why do yanks add an third syllable to this word i wonder torso in the road still shouting threats at his nemesis this film is also about a sort of living dead vanessa redgrave inappropriate name for the grave dodger shown here goes on and on dying whilst having inappropriate guilt she s not worried about having been a wide-eyed breathless bimbo but imagines herself a murderess obviously being a girlie film there s a chap who is supposed to be the mr darcy heathcliff character i m not a woofter so i can t claim to be a good judge of such things but the tedious wimp who is wheeled out for this role seems only to have the title of servant in his favour he s a bloodless cypher as you might gather the main characters aren t much cop but the minor ones manage amazingly to be much worse there s a fellow whose only job is to react to the news that his girlfriend is preggers fair enough but it isn t the role of hamlet - why ham it up so badly forgetting that it was a girlie film i thought he was going to be thrown out because any decent girl-friend would have told him that face-fungus didn t flatter him but then i realised that she must have encouraged him to grow a beard because he looked worse without it i kept awake by noticing which actors and actresses had their earlobes attached or free and noting interesting bits of scenery - if you re dragged along to it see if you can spot the stuffed buffalo head just the sort of thing you d expect in a beach cottage apart from the obligatory wedding there is only one piece of action you d have thought that they d have got it right sadly though the hit and run accident is carried out by a car that couldn t be there when the accident is discovered the cast wander about shouting for a character that they can t know is nearby but we do as the audience if they don t have any clue that the person is within a couple of miles of the place then why do they wander about aimlessly shouting for him i suppose that the director s excuse is that it is supposed to be a half-remembered dream sequence another scenery item that caught my attention was a copper bottomed saucepan i didn t think that the technology to do this was developed until the fifties 	NEG
if you have seen friends the writing will feel very familiar especially the last or seasons of friends often share the same comedy setups the show is about a group of people whose connection is that they shared the same class when they were still rather young about years old i think now they re in their mid-twenties and they meet again on a class reunion this is where the series starts a typical episode deals with multiple story lines at once they re usually not connected in any way each story line is cut up into multiple sections which are then shown in a mixed order the sketches is where my problems lie with this series as in the later seasons of friends it s often a rather silly setting with hard to believe situations one of the main characters does something really stupid that s hard to believe the situation is then heavily exaggerated as if it wasn t silly enough if you re into this kind of in-your-face humor then maybe you ll like this series for me it is a great turn-off the reason i started watching friends is because of the first few seasons there are interesting and especially credible story lines with some romance in it that makes you root for the characters the class has none of this the characters are simply too forced and stereotypes are pushed too far it s therefore not possible to relate to them and like them at least with friends it took several seasons before it ran out of steam and the character traits were all milked out but in the class it seems it has run out of steam before it even started 	NEG
i m going to have to disagree with the previous comment and side with maltin on this one this is a second rate excessively vicious western that creaks and groans trying to put across its central theme of the wild west being tamed and kicked aside by the steady march of time it would like to be in the tradition of butch cassidy and the sundance kid but lacks that film s poignancy and charm andrew mclaglen s direction is limp and the final minutes or so are a real botch with some incomprehensible strategy on the part of heroes charlton heston and chris mitchum someone give me a holler if you can explain to me why they set that hillside on fire there was something callous about the whole treatment of the rape scene and the woman s reaction afterwards certainly did not ring true coburn is plenty nasty as the half breed escaped convict out for revenge but all of his fellow escapees are underdeveloped they re like bowling pins to be knocked down one by one as the story lurches forward michael parks gives one of his typically shifty lethargic mumbling performances but in this case it was appropriate as his modern style sheriff symbolizes the complacency that technological progress can bring about 	NEG
probably somebody heard of alberto tomba a former policeman a former sky champion and now a terrible actor alex l ariete was planned to be a tv mini serial but the italian television itself refused to show the movie on its channels now it s a believe me ridiculous movie the script it s simply hilarious it s supposed to be a dramatic movie something like a years old kid work but what really blows you away it s the amateurish acting: alberto tomba who actually was not believable as a policeman himself plays terribly a totally silly character: a special operations italian policeman specialized in smashing doors open ariete is ram this super-guy will try to save a young nice girl life an actual italian little tv showgirl married to the singer eros ramazzotti : nice but absolutely inept in the acting lose this one and make yourself a favour a movie that is a shame to italian cinema industry: only john travolta in earth attack got close 	NEG
there are really two sections of this film firstly there s the laughable prologue to the film which is so hysterical and cornball that it would almost feel appropriate that the the simpsons troy mcclure should be doing the narration then the rest of the film begins starting off with a title song which really doesn t fit in with the rest of the film which while technically ok is killed by a vague inconsistent and unconvincing plot and not just uninteresting characters but characters that make no sense this is especially so with mickey rooney s spiventa who was supposedly in on the plot and part of the organisation the whole time yet what would have happened had hackman made the seemingly arbitrary decision to take him along when breaking out in that case he would ve been a totally superfluous and unnecessary character which in the end he still is the overall problem of the film is that it s totally unwilling to put any detail on who or what is behind this conspiracy it s as if the filmmakers didn t have the courage to imply that a particular section of society would be capable of creating such an organisation and instead settled on the hope that a lack of explanation would suffice and the audience would form their own conclusions put simply the film fails on all levels 	NEG
there are a lot of pretentious people out there who will pretend that this is endowed with some kind of beautiful meaning and that ignorant fools like me don t get it obviously this means that we should stick to hollywood dross it has every a-hem artistic cliché in the book - i guess it is good that the director is one of the chosen few almost a self parody drowning in its own pretense the director of the almost equally embarrassing movie ratcatcher returns with another piece wallowing in artistic nonsense; it is difficult to understand and apparently is a study of alienation the best way to describe this film is alienating for its viewers 	NEG
a lot of promise and nothing more an all-star cast certainly by hk standards but man oh man is this one a stinker no story that s okay the action will make up for it like most hk action flicks what the action is terrible corny and sparse dragon dynasty s releases up to this point are by and large superb and generally regarded as classics in asian cinema this is a blight they managed to wrangle a couple of actors from infernal affairs but they can t bring life to a disjointed script there are scenes of dialogue where two or three lines are spoken with a cut in between each and no continuity in what the characters are saying you almost feel like they re each giving a running monologue and just ignoring the other characters michael biehn is made of wood really sammo hung uses a stunt double no way yes way stay away 	NEG
ok for starters taxi driver is amazing this this is not taxi driver or amazing what it is is bad but i thought it was bad funny which means that it did have some redeeming qualities like the dialogue wow there was more or less no plot the characters were all stupid and the movie was preachy there were some places were i thought the movie would dive into taxi driver type violence which would have hit the message at the end of the movie on the head much harder i can t even believe that there are like other people who have seen this movie yeah it s worth watching if you are real bored and you want to reaffirm the fact that anyone can make a movie or at least can try to 	NEG
nick millard aka nick phillips should have left well-enough alone when he made criminally insane years before the release of this god-awful waste of time and effort the fact that the original criminally insane was less than an hour in length should have clued him into the fact that he had probably milked this storyline for all he was going to get out of it but instead he opts to use tons of footage from the original in this one as well even to the point of recycling the original opening credit sequence unfortunately bringing back the rapidly aging priscilla alden did not save this one what little bit of original footage there was in this flick looks as if it were filmed with a rented hand-held camcorder if this film cost more than $ to make i would be very surprised and i would be equally surprised if it made anything close to that amount avoid this one and watch the original instead 	NEG
just okay horror film about a nice suburban family dealing with the death of their parents and the thing in the basement that they keep feeding people they pick up off the street of course there is more to it then that but to say more would be telling for me this just didn t come together as it tries to have it two ways both as a family drama and a horror film the film tries very hard to walk the cutting edge between the two genres but seems more to stumble all over the place as it tries to be shocking something it never really is it doesn t help that the final revelation is less a scare then an oh as on oh thats it maybe if i hadn t been watching so many horror films recently this might have been better or it may have just seemed it since i wouldn t have compared it to so much i d take a pass	NEG

a couple of farmers struggle in life in a small village in china wang lung paul muni buys o-lan his future wife who becomes his slave luis rainer american stars appear in the leading roles talking with fake accents and emphasizing old stereotypes and patriarchal ideology a good wife many children and land are the best things for men to have they are seen as property and investment because it is a big budget movie in which many extras cooperate big sets are built and special effects take place the movie makers could not take the risk of hiring less popular actors luise rainer won an academy award for this performance which is definitely the worst in the movie her immutable face builds a barrier between her and the audience o-lan is supposed to be the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize with on the other hand paul muni gives a better performance showing his talent ones again another problem with the movie is the ending it seems like franklin did not know when to end the picture this film could be dangerous if it is taken as a truly example of chinese culture and traditions 	NEG

will they ever make movies without nudity and sex this came on at : on sunday afternoon and i couldn t believe what they showed thank god my son was outside or i would have been freaked out if he had seen the soft medium porn do people who make movies not care who they offend or corrupt kids could have been watching after church and that is what they show the acting was good and i enjoyed the suspense but gee there was violence and bad guys but that is to be expected in a western movie randy travis was really good in his role if the writers directors and producers would just quit putting on so much uncalled for sex scenes what has to happen to get them to quit going in that direction where can i complain 	NEG
seriously the only good thing about this year ceremony were the winners although the ceremony itself was pretty short it still was somewhat boring i think it s seriously time to look for a new director and producers for the show who can come up with something really new it s pretty obvious that they tried to make the show more hip and appealing for a younger audience this year by letting beyonce perform and letting p diddy and prince present a category also letting chris rock be the presenter was an attempt to re-new the ceremony and make it more appealing none of it really worked out sure chris rock is a funny guy but he wasn t really a good presenter i really merely saw him as a guy who just talked every now and then in between of the different categories his presence wasn t really as big as for instance billy crystal s also the handing out of the awards was pretty dumb at times not letting everybody come to the stage but also handing out some of the awards in the middle of the theater was plain weird still i can t remember being any more satisfied with the award winners none of the movies really swept away the awards as the last couple of years always had been the case so does that mean it had been a good year for movies with lots of competitive contestants i don t think so i think most of the movies will be largely forgotten in years from now with the exception of million dollar baby and the passion of the christ maybe sure i don t agree with every single award that was handed out this year for instance caleb deschanel should had won for best cinematography not that i don t like robert richardson s work he really did some amazing work for most of oliver stone s work but i really feel that deschanel deserved the award way more also i would had liked seeing jim miller and paul rubell win for best editing and john debney for best music but oh well there is no way the academy awards can please everybody of course i understand that there will always be people complaining about the winners it also was funny to see that most of the award presenters were way more nervous than the nominees and winners did prince said any of the nominees names right at once and were is sean penn s sense of humor al pacino and jeremy i hope they missed irons were the best presenters of the night overall a very forgettable show but with nice winners 	NEG
i read the back of the box and it talked about mary shelley and percy shelley and lord byron i thought wonderful this will be great i was so wrong the story was all screwed up in fact i still don t get it it just seems to me that all the characters did was drink smoke opium and have sex not that those aren t good movie qualities but please where was the story i made myself finish the movie and yes it did pick up towards the end but by then the movie was almost over rent it if you really want to just don t trust the back of the box 	NEG
this film is so ridiculously idiot that you may actually laugh at it but no even this is too much for this lost meters of celluloid i found it as an offer in a magazine and that s why i ve seen it i regret the time i lost to see this out of because they don t have a lower grade 	NEG
this su k why do they have to make movies that they must know su k from the beginning i mean look at alien from if the movie you´r about to make is not better than anything made billions of years before why make it i had problems with the plot and who the main character was that s not good either 	NEG
i couldn t bear to sit through he entire movie do families like this really exist somewhere there have been many comments describing this family as akin to llbean models and such and i think that that is a great description of how they behaved more absurdly unbelievable writing acting occurs as we meet a character referred to in high school as pigface who of course has grown into a drop-dead gorgeous -year harvard-educated plastic surgeon but only to do good in the world-not for the money and she beds steve carrel on the first date that s when i quit watching if you can completely suspend your disbelief for two hours then perhaps you ll enjoy this sentimental self-indulgent waste of time 	NEG
if i hadn t read his name on the dvd cover i never would have suspected that this rather gushy and old fashioned musical was made by a man so closely associated with the french new wave in fact the film is so far from that that i wonder if back in the s and s new wave auteurs would have absolutely hated this type of film--it s so so unreal and it seems to have little to do with so many of his previous films this isn t necessarily a bad thing--just a very surprising thing what i also found a bit surprising was the amount of praise some of the reviewers gave this film--especially when there are so many better french musicals out there the songs in this film were simply not particularly interesting and the characters all seemed so bland and stereotypical if i had to see another rich person who fretted about how hard it is to be rich or get a good sale price on a designer outfit i was going to puke the bottom line is that like american musicals not every french musical is gold this film is not another les parapluies de cherbourg umbrellas of cherbourg or huit femmes eight women and despite the presence of audrey tautou i can t see much reason to recommend it as anything other than a dull oddity 	NEG
i remember watching lost missile actually throwing a fit until my brother and several cousins at whose home i was an overnight guest agreed to watch it with me - i was from time to time the eric cartman of the s - sorry guys and being somewhat embarrassed when the sustained wave of million-degree heat emerged as a plot device - even as a second-grader i knew that a mere missile just couldn t carry the energy around for that much heat or devastation over more than the duration and limited radius of a nuclear detonation my inflicting that turkey on loving relatives was a self-punishing crime the film s production values were very good the acting isn t bad apart from the shatnerism of the actor who played governor s aide that someone else here mentioned but the idea of a missile easy-baking the surface of the earth by means of the heat of its exhaust no how d the people at mystery science theater miss the lost missile anyway it s a great classic of unintentional comedy - watch it if you want something to drink beer to some weekend 	NEG
ah channel of local mexican t v everyday at : a m they air horror movies from the s to early s it was return to cabin by the lake the movie that aired yesterday i regret for watching it the original cabin by the lake was a regularly popular low budgeter and it was good accepted the problem is that this sequel is horrible not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original ugh the plot is really stupid in all the sense of the word the movie at some points looks like a soap-opera because of it s absurd dialogs cinematography and direction my advice is : avoid this one at all costs it s a movie that it shouldn t be watched by anyone not even for lovers of mediocre film-making you have been warned 	NEG
i tried to sit through this bomb not too long ago what a disaster the acting was atrocious there were some absolutely pathetic action scenes that fell flat as a lead balloon this was mainly due to the fact that the reactions of the actors just didn t ring true supposedly a modern reworking of the hitchcock original lifeboat i think hictcock would be spinning circles in his grave at the very thought of it from what i was able to suffer through there is nothing compelling in this movie it boasts a few semi big names but they put no effort into their characters but you know to be fair it was nobody s fault really i mean i m pretty sure the script blew up in the first explosion lol it is possible that this thing ends up improving as it goes along but for me i m not willing to spend at least three days to find out so unless you have at least a three day weekend on the horizon avoid this stinker 	NEG
sometimes a premise starts out good but because of the demands of having to go overboard to meet the demands of an audience suffering from attention-deficit disorder it devolves into an incongruous mess and for three well-respected actors who have made better work before and after this is a mortal shame so let s see premise: a loving couple who lives in a beautiful home is threatened by a bad cop interesting to say the least make the encroaching cop a little disturbing why not it was well done in the hand who rocks the cradle and single white female and it s a proved ticket to a successful thriller now herein lies the dilemma create a disturbing story that actually bothers to bring some true menace into its main characters while never going so far as to look ridiculous or throw any semblance to reality amp up the shock factor and make this cop so extreme -- an ultra bad variation of every other super-villain that s hit cinemas since the silent age the producers and directors chose the latter thus is the resulting film -- badly made with actors trying their darnedest to make heads or tails in roles that they ve essayed before and nothing much amounting to even less 	NEG
warning spoilers following superb recreation of the base in antarctica where the real events of the film took place other than that libelous scandalous filmed in canada; presumably by a largely canadian crew and cast i caught the last half of this film recently on global television here in canada nothing much to say other than how thoroughly appalled i was at what a blatant piece of american historical revisionist propaganda it is; and starring susan sarandon of all people i can only assume that canadian born director roger spottiswoode was coerced to make the usaf the heroes of the film when in fact the real rescuers where a small private airline based in calgary; kenn borek air 	NEG
fulci experiments with sci fi and fails usually in his non horror films we still get sum great gore but not here sum very funny scenes like when the prisinors are forced to hold onto a bar for minutes and if they drop they are electecuted the guy falls and and has some kind of fit on the floor for about two minutes until his friends who were struggling to hold on anyway lift him off the floor the city is an obvious model but not a bad one and the end explosion is at best laughable and dont get me started on the terrible battle scenes 	NEG
this movie was on the romance channel and i thought it might be a goofy s movie that would be enjoyable on some level so my brother and i watched it boy did it suck boy gets crush on girl--correction his dream -girl apparently there is a difference; and i m surprised he realized she was his dream girl--he was smitten with her from over feet away i guess that just goes to show the power of dream-girls boy ends up masquerading as a female to be near dream-girl creative in the sense that it s a far-out plan but un-creative in the sense that there are probably better solutions one might think up awkward situations ensue a match is made all of which takes seems to take place around late afternoon--either the location was somehow responsible for this odd lighting or the actors had to wait until they got off of their day-jobs to come to the set; i suspect the latter very clumsily done very pathetic it s almost never even amusing accidentally so there really is nothing to redeem it unless you re interested in seeing chad lowe s early days before he finally got his piece of the pie with his role as the hiv-positive gay guy on the series life goes on or gail o grady who was on nypd blue and probably got to stare at dennis franz s buttocks but those are unlikely motives--i d say systematic derangement of the senses would be a more justified purpose i m surprised i watched it all i guess it s the kind of thing where halfway through you find yourself still watching due to some morbid self-flagellistic inner-issue and think you might as well finish it so you can tell your friends and family that you actually sat through such a horrible movie on the off-chance that it ll garner you some sympathy for the questionable state of your mental health can you take the challenge 	NEG
a spaceship returns from mars; about a couple of months earlier a -person expedition had been sent to the red planet most of the picture is a flashback to what transpired over there the picture is saddled by inane melodramatic dialog typical of many sci-fi efforts of the fifties & sixties note for example how the ship s commander mohr tells another crew member to stay there for no reason; as if moving to another spot inside the ship will cause a problem later the commander orders two of the crew to remain in the ship while he and another go outside the two he ordered to stay say no way and follow out; i didn t have high hopes for the expedition s success by this point there s much talk of ears twitching and hugging a freeze-ray gun named cleo short for cleopatra of course it would at least be pretty funny unintentionally if the story didn t drag there s a very slow pace to the whole thing; the astronauts spend as much time looking out the ship s window portals which change color from red to blue commenting on what they see as they do outside actually exploring the martian landscape advertised as filmed in cinemagic usually resembles animation cut-outs or drawings shot through an orange-red filter to give the illusion of interacting with the actors who do take on an odd surrealistic appearance due to the process but i don t think it fools anyone over years old the one clever mention i did notice was that the memories of the surviving astronaut would be tinged with unreality so that would explain the unreal nature of the martian vista oh okay i was amused by some of the astronauts actions as they begin to explore; right off the bat they test their freeze gun on a plant killing it just for the hell of it then the female member hacks with a machete at what she thinks is a tree but turns out to be the leg of the spider-rat monster nice going lady look up next time no wonder the intelligence on mars gets upset and doesn t mind that one of the lower lifeforms a giant amoeba attacks the explorers the acting isn t too impressive mohr especially had a very annoying technique saying a line and then abruptly erupting into a huge grin which always creeped me out - reminded me of it the terror from beyond space the ending is fairly anti-climactic; don t expect any huge revelations beyond the no more expeditions with freeze guns named cleo 	NEG

the fourth tremors feature goes back in time to the year the legend begins in the small city of perfection which was then rejection nevada as the story begins seventeen miners are killed by the ghastly graboids some of the characters in the present-day tremors films have ancestors both figurative and literal in the past most obvious is the ever-returning michael gross as hiram gummer unlike his descendant mr gross is inept with firearms; so he hires gunslinger billy drago as black hand kelly to shoot em up some dirt dragons this one takes some getting used to - as it takes place in the distant past it s like a western with miniature versions of the original film s monster graboids these tamer dirt dragons are nowhere near as terrorizing as their tremors counterparts consequently in this film the characters spend an awful lot of time on the ground which would not have happened in the original movie and it was weird to have the citizens give up the fight so quickly when gross temporarily decides to leave town why so helpless why didn t brent roam as juan pedilla immediately rally the people to fight without gross disappointing tremors : the legend begins s s wilson ~ michael gross brent roam billy drago	NEG
after seeing the remake i thought it was the funniest way to see cruella de vil getting her punishment for torturing animals just for their skin the whole movie was quite funny and on my view better than the animated one but there was actually no need for a second one first of all if cruela is returning don t cure her and make her insane again just make her break away from jail and that s a rap i thought it was not very funny it s supposed to have only one original puppy returning i d expected that it should be lucky since he was the most appealing and besides having roger and anita back too however they decided to have a complete recasting and adding not really one hundred not even one hundred and two but only three puppies and a parrot that thinks he s a dog clever gerard depardieu s part was pointless at the end cruella suffers way too much way too humiliating and way too exaggerated to be true she gets baked inside a giant cake that was a desperate attempt of physical humor trying to imitate the same effect from the first one that just didn t work it was too much over the top and not too funny i actually felt sorry about cruella 	NEG
anyone who visited drive-ins in the s s and s must have seen a film or two by american international pictures a distributor that resembled s giant cannon films wherever movie-goers ventured aip would be right there to supply the latest en vogue titles - in the s came horror movies like voodoo woman and the undead; in the s were frankie avalon-annette funicello beach comedies and biker flicks like the glory stompers; and into the s aip churned out grindhouse-level trash like cannibal girls and sugar hill dillinger released in is one of the more highbrow aip efforts that capture the true spirit of drive-in film-making; it is one of those uneven over-the-top flicks that satisfied the masses thirst for entertainment craftsmanship and common sense be damned on the whole dillinger is typical for its era: entertaining and worth a couple of hours but certainly not memorable heavy on action and short on both acting and historical fact dillinger was a fair effort by screenwriter-director john milius magnum force but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive career the -minute dillinger - epic for aip s scope - follows the quest of fbi midwest chief melvin purvis played by academy award winner ben johnson purvis was the investigator who sought revenge for four fbi agents killed in a kansas city ambush that helped gangster frank nash to escape justice at large were the men who supposedly plotted that breakout including expert bankrobber john dillinger warren oates pretty boy floyd steve kanaly and psychopath baby face nelson richard dreyfuss dillinger eventually joined forces with floyd and nelson taking along homer van meter harry dean stanton and harry pierpont geoffrey lewis he also hooked up with billie frechette michelle phillips a prostitute of french and indian extraction while taking place over several months in - dillinger is basically a chase film with purvis s entourage looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by j edgar hoover dillinger has a documentary feel listing dates and places while johnson supplies loose narrative as purvis milius keeps an honest depression look using authentic fashion cars weapons and buildings; he also sprinkles around black-and-white photography and stock footage of gangster shootouts the film is never boring moving at a quick if haphazard pace the action scenes are dillinger s strongpoint edited competently by fred feitshans jr in his last professional effort thousands of blank ammunition rounds must have been used to make this film not to mention pounds of explosives this film is certainly not for the squeamish with people getting shot and dropping dead all over the place the violence while gratuitous brings some understanding of the mayhem that organized crime dumped on american life this film never transcends its exploitation status however because the needed writing just isn t there john milius somewhat overrated as a filmmaker places way too much emphasis on action the action scenes mostly blood-filled shootouts are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era including s bonnie and clyde but we simply don t get to know much about dillinger and his gang members as people; the vital relationship that develops between dillinger and frechette is barely touched upon with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward melvin purvis also seems to wander in and out of the storyline becoming a prominent figure only when milius needs to keep the film from unraveling all too often the film takes on a shoot- em-up persona when its characters could have been explored in detail aside from this the picture s main crime is ignorance of historical fact while many say that dillinger is just a film it s films such as this one that create fables and make them permanent those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that john dillinger was not the last of his ring to die as milius s screenplay and the film s documentary style encourage us to believe in fact dillinger died before baby face nelson and homer van meter; he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death nor did he have billie frechette in tow while these inaccuracies might make for high drama there is no reason why milius couldn t have stayed with the facts and written a great story around them warren oates s performance as dillinger is quite good although he sometimes looks unconvincing oates is humorous and nicely portrays how dillinger became consumed by his larger-than-life image in the american press; however we never really feel the menace he invoked in his lifetime ben johnson gives some life to purvis suave but rather flat michelle phillips brings emotion to the billie frechette character and it s really too bad that milius s screenplay didn t flesh out her relationship with dillinger we never learn what drew her to a cold-blooded killer other than the stereotype of an easy-going girl who is attracted to men of danger the supporting roles with kanaly dreyfuss stanton lewis and a briefly-appearing cloris leachman are acceptable for such talent as a piece of s exploitation dillinger appears doomed to retail bargain bins which is exactly where i picked up mgm s dvd release for $ the film is nicely presented in widescreen a must for drive-in flicks with subtitles in french and spanish dillinger s theatrical trailer is supplied as a lone extra largely forgotten except by gangster movie fans and drive-in enthusiasts the film doesn t really call for much else in way of supplementary material for fans of the genre it s certainly worth checking out out of roving reviewer - www geocities com paul_johnr	NEG
the comparison is perhaps unfair but inevitable those attracted to the intimacy and depth of umbrellas will be slightly horrified to discover a cut-and-paste musical in the american style - awkward stilted dialogue with inexplicable song-and-dance numbers gene kelly s french accent was apparently so poor that a dreadful job of dubbing was substituted as you ll remember the dubbing was almost perfectly pulled off in umbrellas the translation of the french for subtitled versions as well leaves something to be desired although this can t be attributed to demy the film also has several self-aware moments that come off a wee disconcerting such as references in songs to legrand himself and the costumes - well the tight pants white boots combination and the freakishly unnatural colors reminds one of an austin powers film but demy does reward the viewer with allusions to umbrellas; note for instance the suitcase carried by maxence in his departure from rochefort - this is the same suitcase carried by guy in his departure from cherbourg also note the convenient brunette of resolution - madeleine in umbrellas and josette in young girls generally speaking those expecting the natural feel of umbrellas save the floating bicycle scene or looking for similar deeper questions and ambiguous endings as in umbrella s script should probably pass this one b y those looking for a french version of a thin s american musical will be quite happy 	NEG
it s sort of hard for me to say it because i so greatly enjoyed both targets and paper moon but i thought the last picture show was a somewhat fascinating but overly self-indulgent film its main positive as far as i m concerned is the stunning photography but for me the film had nothing to offer beyond surface beauty and a kind of hidden beauty at that the characters were very hard to relate to or to care about basically you had this very slow pace and this naturalistic style of acting but it was all there to prop up a very formulaic and predictable story complete with all the trappings one would expect from any small town melodrama -- everything from the boy cheating with his teacher s wife to the handicapped kid who everyone picks on it was like american graffiti without the joy of life some might say this film is more realistic -- nowadays a lot of people seem to think that realism is the only virtue a film can possess but for me the film was simply oppressive and i want to see it again about as badly as i d like to spend a few hours in that miserable town the characters live in maybe this film really just belongs to its time -- perhaps if i d seen it in i would have been impressed by its novelty just by seeing something different on the screen but that would basically assume that i had never seen anything like say godard s breathless maybe the overt references to classic films would have appealed to the movie geek in me and helped me to overlook some of the film s weaknesses but in the post-tarantino world that hardly seems unique or special either it is interesting though how he uses the films in the film to give his own film more depth we see films as i recall in the picture show first we see vincente minnelli s father of the bride -- liz taylor s exquisite looks provide a contrast to sonny s girlfriend and minnelli s studied upper-middle class milieu contrasts to the character s real life surroundings in a similar way later clips from howard hawks red river emphasize the theme of a broken friendship between a mentor and a protégé it really just reminds me that bogdanovich is kissing his own mentor s butt much as he did if i remember correctly by selecting a hawks film as part of his own on-screen reverie with boris karloff in targets i guess in this kind of thing was new but looking at it today it just seems self-indulgent like so much of the rest of this film ultimately i d rather see another film by hawks ford or minnelli than to have bogdanovich s film remind us of why they were so striking in such a less-than-subtle way maybe he intends to remind us of the giants whose time had passed -- all he really does is remind us how small he and most of his contemporaries are in relation 	NEG
decent animation and some workable character development keep this animated horse fable from dreamworks at least watchable however it remains somewhat slow paced and the storyline is a bit on the silly side it is interesting to see a reversal of the typical cowboys and indian roles but here it just seems like a nod to political correctness rather than a proper storyline decision grade: c	NEG
i am a kind person so i gave this movie a instead of a it was without a doubt the worst movie that i ve seen in a long time there was very little plot and the deeper interesting areas that were touched upon i e what jesus may really have wanted us to know were glossed over and instead we were given heavy visual doses of sadistic punishment inflicted upon our heroine arquette total crucifixion in the first minutes would have been more humane to both her character and the audience the acting was barely there and the direction was uninspired and if i saw one more drip of water or dove flying toward the camera i may have started screaming louder than patricia 	NEG
i think a round of applause is in order for whoever pieced together the trailer for rogue pictures latest release the return i myself along with everyone else have been duped into believing it is in fact a horror film on the contrary though its actually a supernatural thriller too bad it is not the least bit thrilling the return stars sarah michelle gellar as joanna mills a young woman who has had personal problems since the age of eleven it was at that age that she began having haunting visions depicting the murder of a woman whom she has never met while in texas on a business trip she is led by these visions to the murdered woman s hometown la salle there she comes face to face with another person who has frequently appeared in her visions a man by the name of terry stahl who is played by peter o brien joanna is now on a desperate search for answers a search that could in the end result in her very own murder i really don t know where to begin here folks which should i mention first the atrocious acting hideous directing or the terribly bland story no matter which one i choose my point behind each is the same: they simply suck adam sussman s screenplay is downright moronic its not interesting its not compelling its just plain unpleasant i kept waiting for something to jumpstart the film i ve placed quotations around film because i don t believe the return deserves to be called an actual film due to it s foulness and at least give it some slight chance of hope but nothing ever happened i was left out in an unbearable cold to freeze not even stellar performances from the actors themselves could have saved this disaster of course they probably knew this having read the script then agreeing to do the film i assume this is why the acting was so awful at least that s what i m choosing to believe i really hope the cast doesn t pride themselves on their performances they need immediate medical attention if they do now the directing was unmistakably bad but i can t quite crucify asif kapadia entirely well i could but i won t since i m such a nice guy i look at the return as a test for kapadia because for all of you that don t know this is his first full-length feature film he s just getting his foot in the door and still learning next time around well if there is a next time hopefully he will have improved vastly the only thing he was able to accomplish here was almost completely duplicating the visual style of marcus nispel s re-make of the texas chainsaw massacre now that s nice the film was given that but unfortunately he still won t be receiving any kudos from me for that copying someone else s work isn t something i consider to be praise worthy even if it is from a film i very much enjoyed i think jim sonzero s american re-make of pulse will now have to fork over the title of worst film of the year to the return it beyond question is deserving of the title in almost every imaginable way now i don t doubt this will make a small and i mean very small profit no matter what though it won t surpass or even parallel the fluke success of gellar s previous acting effort the grudge on that note there s one last thing i d like to add i can honestly say i had never been embarrassed to have been seen leaving a theater auditorium until seeing the return that is something i never wish to experience again along with the film itself 	NEG
if this is all the watchowski s have to offer in terms of a back story to the matrix than i really have to question the claims of all of the fans who believe that the movies are intended to register on a deeper level the second renaissance while visually stunning & beautiful is story-wise cliched & ludicrous how many times have we heard the story of humans relying too much on technology humans all-too eager to make war humans basically destroying themselves there is nothing new here and i have another question considering the plot of the second renaissance doesn t that make the machines the good guys the machines are oppressed for generations by their cruel human overmasters they fight back win their freedom and seek to establish a peaceful harmonious coexistence with the humans who reject them in favor of all-out war which the cleverer machines naturally win if this is the back-story then we shouldn t be rooting for neo we should be rooting for the machines the humans were cruel and oppressive while the machines were courageous and attepted to be compassionate since i do not believe that the watchowski s intend for us to favor the machines over the humans i have to believe that the second renaissance was simply a misguided attempt @ creating a back-story 	NEG
this kid is rather bad but in no way do they make him the type that outsmarts adults and can foil experienced thieves at every turn no he is not so much a brat as he is a kid with severe emotional problems a nice couple looking to adopt get rather suckered into adopting him and while the husband is a bit more willing to give this kid a chance the mother is not through in a bizarre michael richards character and the always annoying gilbert gottfried and you have yourself a rather bad movie with a few laughs in it here and there i actually prefer the sequel to this film as i like the fact they brought amy yasbeck back as a different more likable character as there are one to many characters in this film that are thoroughly unlikable as it is even the kid is rather annoying at first in this one and they kind of chill him out in the sequel too the plot is simple enough though as the prospective parents go to adopt this kid that they think is great by the way the orphanage is throwing a party as they depart they soon realize they have themselves a little hellion add to that this little hellion getting into contact with a convict of some sort not sure about this character at first i thought it was supposed to be his real father or something not all that good but i will pick this ahead of that culkin kid any day of the week 	NEG
raymond burr stars as an attorney caught up in the murder of his best friend dick foran thanks to his affection for his friend s wife angela lansbury this was a full year before he started doing perry mason so the movie might be of particular interest to his fans if it was the inspiration for his casting there isn t all that much else here that s interesting though lansbury is always good but her character here is very one dimensional and the motives for her crime in the mystery are totally obvious there s an interesting performance by lamont johnson as a painter who s also in love with the femme fatale but the burr character is pretty straightforward it s frankly bizarre to see an actor like burr doing these romantic scenes with lansbury and his halting delivery does not match his character here very well as it does in most films i ve seen him in there s no mystery at all really and the whole suspense is supposed to be around the title of the film and the way that burr s character is setting up the lansbury character to implicate herself double jeopardy prevents her being tried again for the original murder presumably he does so with a very large tape recorder which she doesn t notice when she comes into the room i guess a few perhaps unintentionally fun moments and basically the rest of the thing could have been done for tv 	NEG
if you re the kind of movie-goer who enjoys original content and intelligent suspense then look elsewhere kids cause sleepwalkers really sucks usually i m more eloquent than that but wow this was bad i especially love it when charles offers tanya a ride home she declines and then he is seen walking home where s his car anyway just don t see it folks i really want to be more specific but words escape me cats jumping on people a guy getting stabbed by corn cheesey lines up the proverbial wazoo just don t see it wait i take that back see it for writer stephen king s cameo as the guy who owns the graveyard he s actually pretty good even with guest appearances by mark hamill and ron perlman king gives the best performance of the film but other than that wow bad 	NEG
if you haven t seen the gong show tv series then you won t like this movie much at all not that knowing the series makes this a great movie i give it a out of because a few things make it kind of amusing that help make up for its obvious problems it s a funny snapshot of the era it was made in the late s and early s you get a lot of funny cameos of people you ve seen on the show it s interesting to see chuck the host when he isn t doing his on air tv personality you get to see a lot of bizarre people doing all sorts of weirdness just like you see on the tv show i won t list all the bad things because there s a lot of them but here s a few of the most prominent the gong show movie has a lot of the actual tv show clips which gets tired at movie length the movie s story line outside of the clip segments is very weak and basically is made up of just one plot point chuck is actually halfway decent as an actor but most of the rest of the actors are doing typical way over the top s flatness it s a good movie to watch when you don t have an hour and a half you want to watch all at once watch minutes at a time and it s not so bad but even then it s not so good either ; 	NEG
watchable little semi-soaper but hardly captivating still two or three funny moments what amazes me is how slippery and morally highly questionable mcnicol is she plays an invalid a leg problem yet she not only isn t the ugly duckling whom men shun but she is even a man-eater - and we are supposed to feel for her oh poor little mcnicol with her leg problem poor little mcnicol she is constantly getting passes from men and even dumps them without so much as blinking at one occasion she even has a premeditated one-night affair with a blond stud and then she tells her newly-found french girlfriend quite non-chalantly that it took him time to get an erection makes us viewers wonder why she is so leg-conscious if every guy wants to hump her well almost every guy; the only guy who really shunned her after seeing her leg wrapped up in metal is the guy working on the telephone but otherwise she seems to be doing just fine with men no shyness no lack of success with men and she throws them away like toys; the way she dumped carradine was ridiculous poor little invalid girl i don t think so and yet we are meant to believe that this woman has a major confidence problem; hence the scene in which she prepares to start playing the flute for a solo concert and somehow manages to throw the notes on the ground out of nervousness nervousness the rest of the movie shows little or nothing that would suggest that she has confidence problems so this flute scene is absurd and doesn t fit into the bigger picture i was also surprised how quickly and eagerly mcnicol makes friends with a french woman who is screwing a married guy on the surface the movie would appear to be a sentimental story of one crippled woman s struggle for acceptance or something like that but it s nothing like that at all; the writer clearly shifts between this type of movie and a screw anything that moves - it s the s kind of movie - very confusing as far as her leg: it s not like she has a big fat purple balloon growing on her calf muscle she only has a normal-looking metal prosthetic attached to the lower part of her leg so i really don t understand why the makers of the film try to make it seem as if she is a female quasimodo or something at the beginning of the film it s not like she has a twin head growing out of her neck though mcnicol is hardly a major catch kind of cutish but nothing special quite average but what the hell is carradine doing playing some kind of a relatively smooth guy flirting with mcnicol and her pal this guy was in revenge of the nerds but i guess it s the same thing with the carradines in the movies as it is with the kennedys in politics: no matter how ugly unable or dumb all the doors are open for a career in movies and politics respectively down with nepotism if you want to read bogus biographies about the carradines and other hollywood nepotists and morons contact me by e-mail 	NEG

yes there are great performances here unfortunately they happen in the context of a movie that doesn t seem to have a clue what it s doing during the first - minutes of this all the music takes place as realistic performance suddenly about an hour in the characters who until this point had always spoken to each other suddenly start singing to each other to further confuse things a little further in out of nowhere they actually do about minutes of sung-through dialog then seem to drop that idea and move on to other things such as a number that begins in a jazz club with a drummer and two electric guitars suddenly turning into a fully orchestrated piece with a massive unseen string section on top of all this inconsistency in how the music is used is the composers clear inability to actually write music in the style that is supposedly being portrayed while the first couple of pieces do sort of mimic the s motown sound the rest of the film is just bad broadway show music then there s the pure silliness of snippets of a group doing a bad jackson family imitation and eddie murphy morphing from little richard to james brown to lionel richie when he started channeling stevie wonder i couldn t help laughing out loud this was clearly one of those films that make me appreciate how little time i have on earth and resent that i wasted two hours of it watching this film 	NEG
sadly marry harron decided to do a fictional account of bettie page s life to go along with her own issues with men as typical in all her work every major male character is portrayed as weak bumbling or twisted to add to her fiction she projects ideas and issues that are not true according to bettie page herself bettie did not leave the biz because she thought it was morally wrong or had religious issues though she became a born-again later in life through the influence of her rd husband- a minister she left it because she was in her late s her acting career had gone nowhere and she felt she was losing her looks the hints of molestation and rape are unvalidated and denied in bettie s own words and are the director s attempts to claim that any woman who did what bettie did must have been victimized by men harron fails to point out that bettie designed her own clothes in almost all her shoots not handed to her by sick fetishists harron also fails to make a point that bunny yeager who did many famous photo shoots of bettie also did many naughty shoots with bettie and was not the morally upright professional photographer portrayed in the film the only saving grace is gretchen mol looks very much like bettie otherwise there are other movies and documentaries more accurate and honest to her life and the people in it 	NEG
spanish horror icon paul naschy stars in this one of his weakest werewolf films but bear with me for a moment most people will be familiar with it under its most common television title the fury of the wolf man and there have been many home video versions of it over the years if you want to be serious about giving it a fair shot though the most workable edition i ve seen of it goes by the title the wolf man never sleeps and it s an unedited and complete european version which restores a couple of disturbing scenes and contains the original nude shots which are missing from fury s print it is also letterboxed naschy plays waldemar daninsky returning home from a trip to tibet only to find out that he s contracted a werewolf curse and that his wife has been having an affair he takes care of her and her lover while in animal form but then becomes a guinea pig for a sexy woman doctor and her female assistant apparently the doc attempts to tame the werewolf and there is a very strange sado-masochistic love scene between her and the hairy and fanged daninsky who is under her trance at least in the original version ultimately we get two werewolves for the price of one as daninsky battles a she-wolf the biggest problem with the movie is that the director according to naschy s claims was often drunk and the results are indeed rather incoherent when watching the wolf man never sleeps copy it s not quite as difficult to make out what s going on though the editing remains atrocious in spots worst of all is occasional non-matching footage of naschy s ravenous werewolf swiped straight from another previous film la marc del hombre lobo aka frankenstein s bloody terror and mixed into this one without any sensible reason the wolf s clothing changes from black shirt to white and back again as does his demeanor; one moment the wolf is walking around lethargically in a hypnotic trance from fury next he is growling and running around savagely from bloody terror really bizarre 	NEG
movie didn t have much plot and was uninteresting basically you spend a lot of time watching people paint also it s very difficult to hear or understand the dialogue -- partially because of the accents but also because words are mumbled 	NEG
i was thinking that the main character the astronaut with the bad case of the runs in his case his skin hair muscles etc could always get more movie work after he d been reduced to a puddle all he has to do is get a job as the blob the premise of this flick is pretty lame an astronaut gets exposed to sunspot radiation i think and so begins to act like an ice cream cone on a hot day not only is this a puzzler but apparently he has to kill humans and consume their flesh so that he can maintain some kind of cell integrity huh have you ever noticed that whenever any kind of radiation accident or experiment happens the person instantly turns into a killing machine why is that the astronaut lumbers off into the night from the secret facility which has no security whatsoever shedding parts of himself as he goes apparently he retains just enough memory to make him head for the launch pad maybe because he wanted to return to space thus begins the part of the movie that s pretty much filler with a doctor wandering around with a geiger counter trying to find the melting man by the buzz he gives off he kills a stupid bill gates look-alike fisherman scares a little girl a la the frankenstein monster movie and finishes off a wacky older couple punishing them karmically for stealing some lemons then there s a short scene where he whacks his former general and a very long scene where he kills a young pothead and chases his girlfriend around you d think that after she cuts his arm off and he run away the scene would shift but no we re treated to about ten minutes of the woman huddled into a corner panting and screaming in terror even though the monster is gone all i could think was director s girlfriend anyone the end of the movie is even lamer than the rest of it the melting man finishes turning into a pile of goo and then nothing that s it that s the end of the movie well at least that meant that there was no room for a sequel 	NEG
once again a film classic has been pointlessly remade with predictably disastrous results the title is false as is everything about this film the period is not persuasively rendered and the leads seem way too young and too vapid to even be criminals arthur penn s film had style humor a point of view and was made by talented people even if the version didn t exist this would still be an unnecessary film the version strayed from the facts presented a glamorized version of bonnie and clyde but it was exciting and innovative for and it had some outstanding performances that allowed you to care this remake seems culled from the original film rather than the truth as known and the actors in this version are callow unappealing and not the least bit interesting by all means skip this one and hope the version will be better could it possibly be worse 	NEG
i ll start with what i liked i really liked the songs everything about them was great the costumes music lyrics as long as the translation was good : choreography everything i loved the crab scene and the cooking scene but that s about it i get it arty cinema blablabla but too much is too much too much silence it was interesting for an hour but two hours of hearing steps and moaning from time to time really too much boredom no movie should ever be boring no matter how deep it was to be too much porn-like scenes i do get it really i get that they were filming a porn movie there but really really really that is too much i truly think that cinema should be for watching and this one is definitely not watchable in no way stars for the songs 	NEG

you already know how painful to watch this movie is but i wonder why one of the worst movies ever should include one the most beautiful cars why the cars should be not only the victim of violation but also the only true actors and performers in it so how on earth you porsche lamborghini or whatever could allow those people to get in touch with your cars and ruin you reputation for which you give millions stop the getting an advantage of the cars and earn money on their chests it is painful for those who love cars it is painful for those who love movies i want my money back 	NEG
if the scale went negative i would be happier seeing sushmita sen was nice and nisha kothari has a bright future but the producer and the director ruined any and all enjoyment in this story the choice of angles choice of lighting and well everything distracted from trying to remember what is the story oh if the songs and dances haven t caused you to rip your ears off your head first the film could have been made twice at hours and been pretty good kinda like seven samurai but the director and writer didn t go that direction even if the townsfolk finally find their backbone and want to help this movie fails on so many levels: editing writing photography angles style lighting script - name any aspect of this film - it was bad - probably the food from the caterer was bad too i have never in years of watching indian bollywood movies seen something this badly made 	NEG
fashionably fragmented yet infuriatingly half-realized character-study an examination of the different personalities of two college roommates: a talented but undisciplined star basketball player and a pot-smoking womanizing rabble-rouser we never learn why these young men are friends they may share confusions about the world and their places in it but they don t seem to have anything else in common making his directorial debut jack nicholson--who also co-wrote the screenplay with jeremy larner based upon larner s book--doesn t introduce us to the characters with any clarity nor he does shape the scenes to help us identify with anyone on the screen there are some very decent performances here particularly from newcomer william tepper in the central role but most of the picture is unformed perhaps intentionally sketchy or unsure bruce dern plays the hard-driving basketball coach karen black is the older married lady tepper is having an affair with and michael margotta is tepper s wayward friend in an off-putting over-the-top performance nicholson fails to set up the sequences with any particular flavor preferring i assume to let the character interaction dominate the film s tone; his script is no help either and as a result it is unclear whom we re supposed to sympathize with small random moments do work a supermarket fight between tepper and black dern visiting tepper in his dorm-room all of the scenes set on the court however the entire third act of the picture is an excruciating mess hoping to juxtapose an all-important b-ball game with a sexual assault nicholson shows no style at his craft nor does he earn points for chutzpah as his staging of these events is squashy and ugly when a director goes out of his way to humiliate his actors one has to question his motives in doing so perhaps if drive he said ultimately made some sort of powerful statement in the bargain audiences could forgive the filmmaker for his lapses in judgment and taste unfortunately the perplexing closer is as dumbfounding as much of the rest of the movie from 	NEG
this documentary is at its best when it is simply showing the ayurvedic healers offices and treatment preparation there is no denying the grinding poverty in india and desperation of even their wealthier clients however as an argument for ayurvedic medicine in general this film fails miserably although indian clients mention having seen aleopathic doctors those doctors are not interviewed and we have to take the vague statements of their patients at face value-- the doctor said there was no cure the doctor said it was cancer etc well no cure doesn t mean no treatment and what type of cancer exactly does the patient have the film is at its most feeble when showing ayurvedic practice in america there it is reduced apparently to the stunning suggestion that having a high powered wall street job can make your stomach hurt 	NEG
every generation fully believes it is living in the end times this has been true for thousands of years now and movies like this feed on this how did they get the great orson welles to narrate this train wreck this is a documentary about the biblical prophecies of armageddon it tries to link the prophecies as well as it can to what was happening in the times it was made making it obviously dated and kind of silly the reenactments look like they are out of unsolved mysteries but without the high production values people should have been embarrassed to take part in this in short the movie is dated silly reactionary and useless good if you want a good laugh but not good enough to actually look for 	NEG
i gave it a just because natassia malthe as the vampiress quintana looks sooooo sexy in this movie certainly there is very little logic to this movie but so are most of the sci-fi vampire flicks the movie probably tried too much to break away from the traditional vampire stories unfortunately it went too far and made the whole story not just unreasonable but ridiculous there is too much gore and too many rip-off-the-body scenes that made me feel sick a good vampire movie should be more sensible that you don t need to see a lot of blood -- we all know when a vampire jumps on a human he she is going to do what a vampire will do a few moans or screams are all it needs to describe the scene like the one at end when quintana tries to sexually arouse rosa all it needs is a few moans the rest is your imagination anyway it s just my personal taste 	NEG
this is not a good movie too preachy in parts and the story line was sub par the d was ok but not superb i almost fell asleep in this movie the story is about young flies that want to have adventure and follow up on it the characters are lacking i truly do not care about these characters and feel that there was nothing to keep an adult interested pixar this is not i would have liked to see more special d effects also i wold like to see more fly jokes than the mom constantly saying lord of the flies pretty sexist in showing the women as house wives and fainting 	NEG
a low point in human interaction was reached by the maysles brothers with this film do remember you who used words like masterpiece when reviewing this film that these maysles creeps didn t just happen to drive to the hamptons and happen to shoot film on some eccentric people no when they found these two poor pathetic people they then had to finance their project and imagine what they told the money people to sell the project then they befriended the two extremely vulnerable women no meeting of minds here or real consensual participation these wretched maysles smiled kissed ass did whatever they had to to get the beales to cooperate and then exploited them as viciously as has ever been done one would like to think that these hustlers had occasional thoughts of remorse and guilt but the film-making process given the preplanning actual shooting and then editing took a lot of time and their goal had no provisions for actually relating to the beales as human beings an exploitation film perpetrated by the vilest of people as time accrued their film-making reputation has been seriously stained by what they did here their reputation as human beings is execrable that is what people will remember them as grotesque hustlers 	NEG
like a latter day ayn rand bigelow is la major muy macho in her depiction in the film of a few tough american hombres stuck in iraq defusing roadside bombs set by the ruthless relentless child-killing arab terrorists as bigelow posits the iraq war as the backdrop of the grand stage of human drama one veteran bomb expert gets blown up and another shows up to replace him in the dusty hot ugly rubble that is iraq and a new hero is born the new guy is what john hershey described in his book and later the movie the war lover as a sadistic wingnut who actually isn t fit for civilian life and requires the stimulation of war to sublimate and suppress his errant sexual desires the war lover can only fully function in war peacetime suffocates him while hershey chastised the war lover played in the film by steve mcqueen in one of his greatest roles bigelow glorifies him the army needs war lovers they are the bulwark of defense against our enemies we can t handle the truth that it is war lovers who are the best soldiers the toughest men according to the unironic bigelow regular men are pussies the war lover is a special breed the last of the cowboys so what if he wants to bare-back his men or fondle an iraqi boy he is a throwback to the sex-and-death cult of war in war sex is a thankless loveless don t-ask don t-tell kind of male bonding bigelow has no opinion on this; she just limits the options of masculinity in this ham-fisted attempt at realism only a war-lover can win the moral struggle between right and wrong between american innocence and arab perfidy bigelow disguises her racism and arrogance behind the ingenuous facade of journalism she s just another gung-ho yahoo depicting a brutal war against civilians as a moral triumph of the spirit on the political front bigelow returns to the western genre and its relentless clichés again and again ad nauseam: the wonderful world of the open frontier which happens to be some one else s country you can shoot people here says a soldier ; the tough but human black guy companion the soldier with a premonition of death the gruff possibly crazy commanding officer the college-educated fool who tries to befriend the enemy you name it bigelow resurrects it the man-boy love is palpable in scenes with the cute arab boy who befriends the war lover but bigelow plays it straight; she doesn t consummate the sex just sanitizes it what bigelow really wants to show us is the ugly sneering face of the arab enemy any iraqi who isn t pure evil is either demented hostile or up to no good anyway they all deserve to die for their impudence and many of them do in this glib gore-fest film the iraqi women are all hysterical they only make their presence known by screaming they could be male stunt men in drag for all i know you never see their faces there is no female presence at all on base or in battle although female casualty rates in iraq would certainly disprove this bigelow goes through all the motions one by one she glorifies war she canonizes the sadist nut-case hero the cowboys surrounded by the subhuman indians prove their mettle by doing god s work and subduing the wretched terrorist-infested hellhole with sheer bravado and suicidal mania toward the end i felt like rooting for the indians in bigelow s world though no mercy or understanding ever makes it through the iraqis are dehumanized par excellence the slaughter of civilians is just the dramatic backdrop to our hero s psycho sexual struggle every u s bullet finds its mark you have to love the guy the war lover it s just his way he is the true hero he s just a guy trying to get things done the hard way and so what if he lusts for boy tang on the side 	NEG

 was the year this was long before phillip seymour thomas had won an oscar who knew i would be an extra in a movie with him i was actually a paid extra in my boyfriend s back which was shot in a suburb of austin called georgetown tx the original title was johnny zombie thank god the producers had a change of heart i was in the theater scene i rushed out to watch the movie the day it was released in theaters it is more of a comedy than a horror movie but for a good laugh you might want to check it out nothing that is even close to dawn of the dead or even shaun of the dead quality but the cheese factor is good enough ciao	NEG
this movie was a great disappointment for me i had been waiting for this movie to come out for years and i was a faithful follower of chaos comics until they went bankrupt not only did they cut out half the story line but they altered information the statement that lucifer is hope s father is untrue he did corrupt her father but he himself is not her father the voices also did not suit the characters and once you hear the voice of a beloved character the voice you heard in your mind can never be returned i can not even remember everything about this film that was wrong the bottom line is if you love lady death do not watch this movie it just did not do the comic justice at all 	NEG
the tortuous emotional impact is degrading whether adult or adolescent the personal values shown in this movie belong in a bad psychodrama if anywhere at all this movie has a plot but it is all evil from start to end this is no way for people to act and degrades both sexes all the way through the movie teen killing - bad preteen sex - bad emotional battering - bad animal cruelty - bad psychological torture - bad parental neglect - bad the only merit if any is the excellent color shots of contrasting red blond and green leaves a bad feeling for anyone that respects life and peace what a bad mistake to make or to watch it is ugly	NEG
this is the kind of movie you regret you put in your vcr it is some weird bad rip off version of stephen kings movie misery i cannot understand how this movie got a score because it has no story what so ever and when the movie finally ended i was relieved this movie should have been released as a short-movie instead to much time is spent on the same thing and as in every bad movie everything happens just at the end of the movie in a - minutes time span so before you decide to watch this movie be sure to put some new batteries in your remote control because you are going to do whole lot of fast-forwarding don t worry you wont miss anything important 	NEG

i have always been somewhat underwhelmed by joe dante s original the howling  so i wasn t particularly interested in checking out any of its sequels; some time ago i did catch howling iii: the marsupials  by the same director as this one  and found it to be watchable but nothing special the second instalment however has quite a bad rep and i knew i d have a good time watching it  if mainly to wallow in the sight of dear but pompous horror icon christopher lee squirming in the midst of it all the gracefully-aged star has pathetically asserted a number of times in interviews that he hasn t appeared in horror-oriented fare since his last picture for hammer films back in anyway this film should have borne the subtitle your movie is a turd  being astoundingly inept in all departments beginning with the all-important werewolf make-up the plot and dialogue is not only terrible but it has the limpest connection with dante s film  strangely enough the author of the original novel gary brandner co-wrote this himself still one of the undeniable highlights er low points of the film is the pointless elliptical editing  which tries to give the whole a semblance of style but only serves to accentuate its embarrassment factor similarly phoney and grating are the hokey transitions between scenes the inane punk-rock theme song and the cheapjack special-effects at the climax what about the characters then : lee is the werewolf expert naturally whom everybody thinks a crackpot  until they come into contact with the monsters that is; at the very least though one has to admire the makers ingenuity or gall in devising a stupid subtitle with a dual meaning incidentally sybil danning as stirba werewolf bitch  the subtitle by which this is known in the u k is quite fetching in an assortment of outrageous s&m outfits but her character is virtually given nothing to do except preside over her brood of followers and engage in the occasional hilarious three-way lycanthrope sex ; her two snarling lieutenants one of them a sluttish black girl are especially irritating aiding lee on the side of good are the two yuppie heroes he being the brother of the dee wallace character from the first film and she a colleague of hers and a ragged guerrilla-type band of transylvians still they generally manage to effortlessly overcome danning s rather dumb werewolves notable among them is a knife-throwing dwarf who gets a particularly nasty but at the same time side-splitting demise; he s later revived under stirba s control in order to lure lee by making childish taunts at him all through the village streets into a trap the latter scene has to be a career nadir for the distinguished and imposing actor  well either this or the early sequence in a discotheque where lee is made to don a pair of ultra-cool sunglasses so as to appear inconspicuous among the partying youngsters in the end if i were forced to mention elements in this which weren t entirely displeasing i guess i could say that the ossuary set in which the heroine is to be sacrificed is interesting or that the hybrid werewolf bat creature danning s pet who likes to inhabit the body of its victims is just too weird to be despised 	NEG
star rating: saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning ray ray winstone has a criminal past has had problems with alcohol and is now forming a drug habit that is making him paranoid and prone to domestic violence to his wife valerie kathy burke who tries to hold the family together but ends up coming off more like a doormat meanwhile her mother janet laila morse is aware of ray s son billy charlie creed-miles and his escalating drug habit that is sending him off the rails the film follows these despairable characters as they tredge along with their lives it is said that the british seem to enjoy being miserable and that would include watching films that entertain them this way films like nil by mouth highlight this it s a tale of a broken family torn apart by crime poverty booze and drugs the kind jeremy kyle would lap up like a three course meal it is also essentially a tale of self destructive men three generations apart and each copying the other tearing a family apart and women trying to hold it together despite not being strong enough if you pick up a little of what it s about from the off-set you can see it doesn t promise to be cheerful viewing from the start and it certainly doesn t disappoint in this it s true what everyone said about the performances and the lead stars winstone and burke do deliver some great acting we see winstone lose it with his wife beating her senseless after some more coke induced paranoia breaking down during a phone conversation with her and unleashing a typical arsenal of f and c words when she refuses to let him see his kid likewise in a private moment we see burke skillfully lose her composure on a staircase the full impact of the night before kicking in this is another of those films where there s no plot to follow as such just a real life feel of these hopeless lives carrying on from one day to the next it s been acclaimed by many including the baftas but it really was just too grim and bleak for me i have no right to criticize it for this knowing what i knew about it from the off-set but sadly this is how i found it 	NEG
i love low budget independent films and had high hopes for this one but this film is static never mind the production value which is very noble for its budget but the pacing is deadly admittedly these folks achieve much with little but the film fails on the most fundamental level it s boring the editing is glacial and the pacing stalls it should have been minutes the best thing about the dr jekyll is mr hyde who isn t seen nearly enough he had the most dramatic potential instead we have to suffer through dithering baltimorean-brits stammer through endless and tiresome exposition it feels like a backwater stage play committed to video noble efforts by everyone in the production but a story this tired needed a kick in the pants and funky new low budget technology should have given it a fresh voice instead it s just a lame retread 	NEG
i picked up time changer because it looked like a nice low-budget scifi time travel movie and i was in the mood for something like that the description said it had something to do with some biblical stuff and time travel but i didn t expect a fundamentalist christian film the movie had decent special effects and an interesting premise that could have gone places and been far more interesting than it ended up being our hero who is a bible professor from the s eventually travels forward to the s and finds that modern life is filled with the influences of evil - jesus is nowhere to be found this wonderful technological feat is accomplished with the assistance of a fellow bible teacher who somehow managed to invent a functional hg-wells-style time machine the movie starts to lose some credibility at this point which is unfortunate because this happens very early in the film earlier or perhaps immediately later can t remember for certain our hero professor was seen teaching what appeared to be a science class where he claimed that scientific findings could only be considered validated if it could be matched with what the bible says what should be obvious to anyone is that this is clearly not what the scientific method is about however it is presented such that the filmmakers appear to prefer the point of view that science is useful only if it supports their claims and otherwise is not useful in any case that belief is perfectly valid and sensible in the context of the character at the time so if we accept that as the fact of life for these bible professors then obviously the professor who went and invented the time machine isn t a very strong believer as i don t think there s any evidence and none was offered for the physics of time travel in the bible so immediately there s a problem with mixed messages and credibility there but never mind after the professor is convinced to take the leap into the future the shock of modern technology was handled quite well in most cases it was also fun to not have it pinned down to an exact year as the character is reading the date off a newspaper to himself a car honks a horn and it scares him into not finishing the date: it s just two thousand and honk some of the shock went on a little too long though for instance the car was one of the first things he encountered when he arrived and around two days later he s invited to a church movie night and takes a ride in a van he sticks his head out the window like a dog might is scared by the headlights and the starting engine etc that seemed a bit off since he d been there a few days by this point and the city appeared to be quite busy with traffic in any case that s easy to ignore the rest of the tech shock was well done - especially his first encounter with the tv which was delayed because he didn t even realize what it was until he saw a kid watching one and using a remote unfortunately our hero predictably starts to preach to virtually everyone he meets as if he s an authority on all life and religion just because he s from the past and is an elder eventually he gets himself a brief moment in the spotlight at the church he had been visiting where he proceeds to explain his concept of christianity to them in a long monologue that was supposed to be moving and insightful but mostly was just more of the same a couple of husbands in the church begin to get a funny feeling about this guy go figure and investigate his name they eventually conclude that he either is a time traveler or is impersonating this long dead bible professor and decide to find out which it is the movie frames these guys as non-believer bad guys for being skeptical just before the professor is to head back to his own time he is confronted by those two men in an effort to avoid being arrested or hauled away he eventually breaks into an almost insane-like rant about how jesus is coming soon and that he s a prophet so they should listen to him just in time he s whisked away and one of the husbands wonders if perhaps this is the rapture he d heard so much about the irony is that this essentially means the professor became a self-proclaimed and most likely false prophet claiming to know that the rapture was near and he was sent by god when truthfully he was sent by his fellow bible professor and did not have any god-given knowledge that was stated or even hinted at as i understand it revelation claims that the time of the end is only for god to know and at the end of the film we see the inventor professor trying and failing to send a bible into the future first then etc as the scene fades out clearly he s trying to determine the exact date of the end times - which he shouldn t be able to know essentially the entire premise of the movie cancels itself out because by being so insistent on their religious beliefs and how certain things are for god to know only it means there couldn t ever be a time machine in the first place because then mankind could find out something that only god should know the entire movie s premise collapses and makes the whole thing basically worthless as it undermines it s own credibility in the end 	NEG

the ending of this movie made absolutely no sense what a waste of perfectly good hours if you can explain it to me please do i don t usually consider myself unable to get a movie but this was a classic example for me so either i m slower than i think or this was a really bad movie 	NEG
sometime i fail to understand what do the directors think when they make a movie i had had a trauma after watching welcome and thought that they wont do it again but after loads of amazing promos tashan finally ended as heart attack such amazing songs in promo - dil haara chhaliya and tashan mein and what u get in the movie zero story predictable plot plenty of akshay kumar stunts and nothing interesting apart from watching kareena after her major weight loss music-wise another major disaster in the music album they have spent time on giving pathetic small dialogs of these jokers and they haven t thought of giving the background song of the scenes when akshay kumar is doing stunts that song is such nice quite comparable to tashan mein and that is not taken in the music album :- if you plan to watch this movie i would say watch it to listen to that background song which goes something like bachchan bachchan pandey overall very disappointed even with the way bhaiyyaji has made attempt to speak bad english go away man i need to puke 	NEG
former brat pack actor and all round pretty boy rob lowe stars in a film set in a high security american prison i had a gut feeling his character was going to be popular for all the wrong reasons like tobias in the first series of oz but proximity isn`t that kind of film it`s more like a man on the run film like the fugitive it also makes a nod to the themes of punishment and justice with james coburn putting in a cameo as the spokesman for a justice for victims pressure group but any intelligent discussion on how society should treat criminals is completely ignored as the film degenerates into tired old cliches of shoot outs and car chases	NEG
very bad very very bad as a fellow who aspires to make be in or - at least - sniff the catering table at a movie set i find it hard to criticize independents who actually got a movie of any sort made however this movie oh dear realizing frightworld doesn t aspire to anything more than crude exploitation an honorable thing in itself and to try to make it conform to more mainstream standards is a mistake and to be fair it is more entertaining than - say - red zone cuba but not by much so i won t try to critique just let me ask throw out some observations if gore is the point of the movie shouldn t you be able to see it if you have hire three sound men make sure at least one knows how to operate the equipment in a horror movie your lead maniac must be scarier than a smurf doll difficult i know but really there is a lot of talented videographers in the buffalo rochester area most you can hire really cheap get one who knows how to frame a scene just because you have someone who knows how to use after effects and other cool programs doesn t mean he should do so every two seconds kudos for getting the girls to take off their tops but next time get girls who s tops we want to see taken off editing should help tell the story or set a mood at the least in this sort of movie editing should sell the gore gags a chainsaw suddenly appearing in a characters stomach is not scary it s sloppy some good things not all the acting was bad jack was pretty good and i liked acid once she started fighting back there was some neat imagery unfortunately it was thrown up on the screen without rhyme or reason acid poptart is a name that deserves a better movie i like the moxie of frightworld too next time now that they have a movie of sorts under their belts i hope all involve aspire to something better than colman francis upgrade at least ed wood 	NEG
 here be spoilers the government has continued to develop the universalsoldier program now called unisol the soldiers are now stronger and are able to take more damage than before however the government is downsizing the project endangered and the supercomputer that is in the middle of all feel threatened so he takes steps to ensure his own safety he activates and controls the unisols and start to run mayhem the only one who can stop them is deveraux van damme this movie is about one thing choreographed fighting the story is bad and is soon drowned in all fights whatever happens and wherever they go they fight unfortunately for this movie it is no fun watching a fight where you know one part of it is indestructible normally you re pretty sure the hero will win but you still want to feel the fights are between two somewhat equal combatants not where one is indestructible and can t lose then the fights just become a tool to stretch time you wait until the final fight when deveraux miraculously finds a way to beat his unbeatable foes to further lower my opinion a desperate and sure sign of a bad movie is how much scantily clad women there are well there aren t really that lot of them because the characters are most men there are at least one woman unisol though but almost every woman is needlessly shown with at least just a bra once the female leads get by with this but we also pass through a strip-club to use a computer no less with much more undressed women these moments do not give anything to the story and is just there to try to please the adolescent-minded male audience so in conclusion boring fights no more no less well maybe less 	NEG

i was china in this film i choose the screen name sheeba alahani because i was modeling at the time in italy and they couldn t pronounce my real name correctly so i choose sheeba and then added alahani since it was similar to alohalani i had never acted before and it shows but it was so much fun to film they gave me acting lessons each morning which obviously were not useful they dubbed my voice thank goodness david and peter were a blast on the set full of good humor and jokes this film was never meant to be taken seriously it was a tax write off according to inside information i give it a because i have a sense of humor but a for the fun i had acting in it 	NEG
last night i decided to watch the prequel or shall i say the so called prequel to carlito s way - carlito s way: rise to power which went straight to dvd no wonder it completely and i mean completely s%&ks waist of time watching it and i think it would be a pure waist of time writing about it i don t understand how de palma agreed on producing this sh#t-fest of a movie except for only one fact that i tip my hat to jay hernandez who plays the young brigante reminded me how de niro got into the shoes of brando to portray the young don corleone in godfather ii but the difference de niro was amazing and even got an oscar for it jay hernandez well he has guts for trying to be a young pacino too bad for him i don t think he will be playing in film anymore and by the way after i watched this sh#$%ty movie i sat down and watched the original carlitos way to get the bad taste out of my mouth 	NEG
i put this movie on in the hotel room to entertain my children the morning we were leaving to go home because i had packed away all their toys toddlers don t like to watch regis and kathie lee or the view my four year old found one scene funny but told me the rest of it was too silly this is a four year old folks anyone over the age of say nine will want to kill their television rather than let this one play itself out to say this movie is bad is like saying the holocaust was a little mistake there are no words for how ridiculous and utterly terrible this film truly is the acting is bad the plot is stupid and the script is pathetically unfunny since this is supposed to be a comedy the fact that you cannot even laugh at the badness of the movie makes it even worse bronson balki pinchot is the worst with some weird fake accent irish-pakistani-bronx-cockney-cajun as far as i could tell but all the characters are awful i haven t watched a real laurel and hardy film in ages but i know that they had to be way better than this what is the point of ruining a classic comic duo with this bottom line: derivative garbage avoid at all costs unless you have some freaky bronson pinchot fetish 	NEG
yuck i thought it odd that their ancient book on curses was made using a common script font instead of hand written the acting is so apathetic at times and so over-dramatic at other times why would a demonico kill the two suspiciously quiet doctors who helped make him immortal just for the heck of it and is it really necessary to show lilith s motorcycle whenever she s out somewhere we get it you spent a little bit of money to rent some third rate crotch rocket it doesn t mean you have to show it all the time the faith s lair looks like an old school battlestar galactica set with some last minute changes there is a scene where we are introduced to a few people on a talk show for about seconds before they are killed without apparent reason and without importance everyone is a throwaway character forgettable characters and an even more forgettable plot make this one of the most ill-conceived movies i ve seen the scifi channel come out with stay away unless you re into bad movies 	NEG
maya is a woman without any interests she just dreams her life away and wonders why she does not feel fulfilled this could be an interesting topic that would need a good story a nice setting and good dialogues it doesn t have any of these this movie is totally boring there are only lengths and no climaxes the only climax is shahrukh khan but although i am a huge fan of his i couldn t stand this movie even he can t make this movie exiting the movie is not as bad as king uncle and if you re an art-house fan or like it slow you might maybe like it it s not funny it s not interesting it s not catching my recommendation: don t watch it 	NEG
becky harris plays the female shopper whose misfortune it is to be in the store at the wrong time and obviously only purpose to be in this film is to supply a reason to wear out remote controls miss harris seems to me to be in her fifties or older when she first comes on the scene once the red haired thug is done with her it becomes apparent that this is no aarp queen if these are not some of the finest assets ever displayed on celluloid i want someone to clue me in absolutely breathtaking in my opinion and i literally wore out my vhs copy capturing her charms i would like to know if this movie is available on dvd the rest of this movie really is not worthy of mention i was hoping to see something fairly convincing and intelligent however i was disappointed on both counts god bless becky harris 	NEG
i didn t expect much from this tv movie you have to set the bar lower than you would for midget limbo for any tbs movie starring antonio sabato jr still it managed to disappoint failing even to be a good-bad film every scene was by rote as if someone had cut and pasted scenes from a dozen movies and tv shows dealing with big business conspiracies into the script leaned back and said my work is done it s all cliche all predictable and even worse the actors are forced to look like they re taking it seriously even when the plot developments are laughable do yourself a favor watch the x-files if you re in the mood for paranoia they handle it better also let anyone know that sitting through fatal error is just that 	NEG
i missed the first or so minutes of the movie but don t think watching it from the beginning would ve made any difference i found the film extremely boring and was disappointed with the acting i remember patrick swayze and some of the other actors roy marsden for instance in outstanding roles but they all disappointed here due to a very weak script kind solomon s mines the very short part of the movie inside the mines was about as exciting as watching paint dry and i doubt that even a pre-school kid would ve been spell-bound by watching the fight of the warriors the entire movie was reminiscent of a cheaply produced american tv series give me indiana jones any day 	NEG

i got this dvd from a friend who got it from someone else and that probably keeps going on even the cover of the dvd looks cheap as is the entire movie gunshots and fist fights with delayed sound effects some of the worst actors i´ve seen in my life a very simple plot it made me laugh ´till my stomach hurt with very few financial resources i must admit it looked pretty professional seen as a movie it was one of the in a dozen wannabe gangsta flicks nobody´s waiting for so: if you´re tired and want a cheap laugh see this movie if not throw it out of the window 	NEG
 steve chris hoffman gathers a group from high school for a reunion at the cabin location where his twin brother wes went missing while they are there a reptilian creature in the shape of a man reminded me a lot of the gillman from creature from the black lagoon awaits in the wilderness choosing the right time to pick them apart one by one a biker ellen ripley-type time female bad-ass kat chase masterson has an underground military bunker she practices experiments in while it also serves as a place of safety from the thing on the bloody rampage kat knows more than she s telling she also suffered the loss of a child but there s another novelty twist most of the group have no idea of this creature might just be more human than they realize and it s former identity might shed some light on a deception only one other person has been hiding since wes death kat holds the key to many of the mysteries that unlock as the group remains near the cabin thankfully a large portion of the film stays away from the creature which leaps in the air while we also see a hazy screen when we look through it s eyes the film has dawson s creek-type melodramatics which often hinder any real tension that needs to build in a little monster movie the direction is very bland leading to a relatively dull experience instead of eliciting scares the cast is rather life-less and uninteresting pretty maggie grace the fog remake might be the only draw for this film 	NEG
this by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life i gave up to watch it after an hour and regretted that hour a lot the acting is horrible and there is almost no plot my guess is that someone came up with a strange shape of an animal and started to make a story around of it borrowing some ideas from movies like resident evil and aliens doesn t result in a movie like them if this going to be a top korean movie i d rather won t bother to see even a korean movie trailer by the way this movies is a good reason to believe that not necessarily a high rating means the movie is promising i think every korean who has internet for online gaming rated this movie over the even though has no clue what it is about 	NEG
i saw this movie with my rock climbing instructor and we found the entire thing so ridiculous as to be beyond pity for one if stallone is out free-climbing by himself there s no need to carry any gear but i guess those dangling carabiners look sorta mountain climby so let s throw them in for those lobotomized folks who think that colorado looks anything like the dolomites in italy where the movie was filmed well the hollywood moguls have got a lot more ridiculous & foul-smelling stuff for you to swallow 	NEG
as a fan of the sookie stackhouse books i find this series to be a totally crass representation of them vampire bill is not very good looking and looks much older than described in the book i found that they have made already wonderfully colourful characters seem very course and vulgar one of the things i loved about the books is that despite all the crap that she is going through sookie is always a lady and yet in the tv series she doesn t seem like that at all not only that but the prejudices displayed in the tv series are not nearly as wide spread in the books i didn t expect an exact replica of the books but i at least expected the feel of them to be used for the series 	NEG
this is a well made informative film in the vein of pbs frontline the problem is frontline already did this piece and managed to bring l paul bremer in to tell his side of the story more troubling is the fact that the director of the film charles ferguson--a former think tank wonk was a war supporter until the occupation went south what did he think would happen the invasion of poland went really well too until it was messed up by those pesky nazis and that is what this film feels like--an apology for occupation rather than a deconstruction of the act of war itself ferguson seems to suggest that the war could have been run better--as if any war can be better 	NEG
this movie is a mess but at least it s not pretentious the box art for the video markets it as a fun throwback to s giant bug movies in reality it s a transparent bargain basement ripoff of aliens the producers clearly wanted to make an alien picture but they mustn t have had much money in fact it doesn t look like they had any money really i hope everyone got paid who worked on this thing the basic plot is retained--group of people isolated with murderous insectoid creature--and an earthbound location is inserted for budgetary reasons i presume instead of setting the film in space where no one can hear you scream they set the film in a hospital where everyone can see your budget laid bare the amusing thing about blue monkey and there is only one thing amusing about it is the filmmakers didn t abandon the alien aesthetics even though we re in a hospital we still have an improbably cavernous annex where science fiction experiments are being conducted in this case the venerable growth hormone plot device the annex also doubles as a boiler room or something so we can have an explanation for the monster seeking out the warmth the boiler room is so large that it is laced with multi-leveled steel catwalks perfect for allowing slime to drip down between the slats the idea is that a man working in a greenhouse is attacked by a drooping flower from a rare imported plant that grows in an exotic location he touches it and says ow so we know he s been hurt the cut on his finger causes him to lapse into unconsciousness in a matter of minutes and at the hospital he gives birth to a white worm through his mouth i guess in an alien picture this would be called the mouthburster the worm is isolated but some naughty little kids leukemia patients sneak up on it and accidentally give it some experimental growth hormone you know everyone s in trouble when some fornicating hospital staff workers are attacked by a camera on a crane and pretty soon a maintenance man finds some obligatory cocoons right before he s grabbed by a pair of semi-convincing insectoid arms the rest of the movie is dominated by the semi-offscreen monster semi-obscured by the semi-darkness which brings us back to alien how you ask can a movie set in a hospital incorporate all those flashing strobe lights that are always in the alien movies no problem a power outage or something causes the electrical system to go awry which apparently causes strobe lights to blossom in every room of the hospital and flicker constantly throughout the movie this doubles as a convenient cloak for the less-than-special effects although the bugs are pretty neat looking they don t move too well and the baby bug looks charmingly like a cootie toy ok so what alien bases haven t we covered oh water dripping down the walls check we ll divide the massive hospital into two parts then send some of the characters through the damp drippy basement to get to the other side problem solved we now have the opportunity for numerous foreboding tunnel shots and don t forget the fog well you never really need an excuse for this in horror movies do you ok maybe inside of a hospital you do so we ll create smoke by having lots of things spark & burn i haven t said anything about the negligible acting not that the actors are given any kind of script to follow i take it blue monkey was supposed to be lighthearted and fun and if so then it is a nice try but the pieces don t come together and the movie ends up being a real drag see a film called return of the aliens: the deadly spawn if you want to see a film of this type that gets it right with even less money and even more marginal acting talent this one falls flat on its alien 	NEG
even + years later ninja mission stands out as the worst movie i ever managed to sit through scandanavian ninjas silently enter a scene fire their obnoxiously noisy sub-machine guns with wild abandon and then silently leave wow how will we find those silent invisible assassins just follow the shell casings and smoke painfully bad dialog or was it brilliant and just poorly translated not an asian in sight in the cast and a whopping total of asians among the stunt crew the plot is ridiculous the acting pretty much non-existent - then again ninja can t act save yourselves - avoid watching at all costs 	NEG
i feel blessed to own what is known as the worst steven seagal movie ever made i knew i was on to something special when steven opened his mouth and someone else s voice came out by the middle of the film my eyes were beginning to hurt and i was almost falling out of my chair with uncontrollable laughter steven is steven with an ever changing voice and totally unbelievable in his role as always who the hell lets people with bad nappy-hair pony tail mullets into the forces anyway he also always writes himself into totally unbelievable love interests with women at least years his junior the supporting actors all look like they ve been shot in the dark - btw did they shoot this movie in the dark with just a penlight torch for lighting this is truly abominable in every way possible invite all your friends around and make a social event out of it - this one s truly special 	NEG
to movie this movie felt like one of those after school specials only lower budget and lower everything else i guess this was supposed to an inspirational movie of some sort but it didn t work for me yet some how it comes across as preachy it has very pale shades of flash dance but so what there just isn t any excitement in this movie the dialogue is contrived and clichéd to death of course the whole movie feels like a bad s cliché the acting was less than stellar though that has a lot to do with what the actors were given or in this case-not to work with on top of that is the poor song choices with really bad lyrics i felt embarrassed for all the actors involved they are all talented but you can t tell from this movie this is just my opinion of course but i have to give flying aka dream to believe a 	NEG

this is quite possibly the worst film i have ever seen worse than the most abhorrent american dross; worse than glitter - mariah carey in american dross par excellence i can only imagine that the writer and producer were taking huge amounts of recreational pharmaceuticals and when discussing the plot actually thought it was a good idea it s not it is abject rubbish from very bowels of satan himself who could probably have written a better script had he put his mind to it robert jones as exce producer spending our tax payers money lottery money folks on this piece of nonsense should be accountable who on earth thought it would be a good idea to re-make deathline i ask you - camp as a christmas tree deathline mind the doors is classic of really bad british film we really don t need a reminder and we certainly don t need a poor second rate badly scripted badly developed and badly piece of rubbish like this all this this from the uk funding agency that brought us sex lives of the potato men i rest my case do not pay any money to see this it is absolute and utter crap - the one saving grace for the producers is that they got a huge wedge of cash our cash for making it they should hang their heads in shame i am staggered at the low low standard of this film it makes me mgr that our national body for the support of film actually thought it was worth supporting there is no hope for the british film industry whilst idiots are running the show harvey wienstein where are you come back we forgive you 	NEG
greetings again from the darkness what ever happened to the great barry levinson he directed two of my all-time favorites in avalon and diner he had some fine movies as well rainman but always provided something of interest until now i believe the worst thing you can ever say about a comedy is that it is boring envy is the definition of boring never of big fan of pure slap stick dumb and dumber i was just stunned at how god-awful this movie is there are maybe chuckles in the whole thing - if you can pay attention that long the best part of the film is the running gag of the title song by a redbone sound-alike if the film had been written as well as the song it would have been tolerable rachel weisz is a wonderful actress and i realize they all want to do comedy even julianne moore but the real world exposes one weaknesses snl cast member amy poehler is her usual over the top in her role as trailer park trash turned princess the disaster of the film is jack black and ben stiller the first work commute together flashes some promise but after that their chemistry disappears due to the poor script this script is like most of jack black s character s ideas - not a bad thought but no hope for success 	NEG
i am not saying that night of the twisters was horrible but it was far from great mediocre at absolute best i seems though that every time one type of movie is released a second must be around the same time think about armageddon and deep impact volcano and dante s peak night of the twisters is really just twister except worse and with mundane special effects i have nothing against the actors who starred in it even if they weren t great it was the movie itself the directing the special effects the whole storyline was just too strange to interpret a series of tornadoes strike a town and basically the movie is about people trying to find family and friends and deal with the damage i really don t know why it seems as though duplicates of disaster movies are released almost in sync with each other but this one would have been better with bill paxton and helen hunt 	NEG
i had to compare two versions of hamlet for my shakespeare class and unfortunately i picked this version everything from the acting the actors deliver most of their lines directly to the camera to the camera shots all medium or close up shots no scenery shots and very little back ground in the shots were absolutely terrible i watched this over my spring break and it is very safe to say that i feel that i was gypped out of minutes of my vacation not recommended by any stretch of the imagination 	NEG
there are no reasons of taking this documentary serious and there are four reasons for that: the people who made this documentary including the director and the producer are serbs or of serbian origin therefore the criteria of neutrality fails for instance they mentioned that the diaspora croats the so called ustase played a huge part in the fall of yugoslavia but they didn t mention that there were equal serbian organizations as well cetniks for you who aren t that familiar with balkan ww history: the serbian so called cetniks that were portrayed in the documentary as being so kind that they helped british paratroops during the war well that s only half the truth they were also a fascist monarch group who collaborated with the germans but then switched side when hitler started losing the war it s also ironic that they don t mention the cetnik leader mihajlovic in the documentary a man that is responsible for killing thousands of people and burning hundreds of villages all over bosnia and croatia but they mentioned a certain ante pavelic hm allow me to be just a little suspicious most of the people interviewed are to me totally unknown and i ve studied this war for a long time who is the old british lady she really hasn t made her homework and they are not even presented by name so they could more or less be anybody maybe someone they took from the street who knows in the documentary they talk about kosovo and how the serbs have lived there for ages and therefore it should belong to serbia even though they are a minority well when they mention the serbian dominated part of croatia krajina suddenly the serbs are portrayed as how they have the right to live there because it has been their home for so long fine but what people don t know is that the largest city in krajina knin has great historical importance for the croatian people it was there where one of the most celebrated kings of croatian history zvonimir was crowned and therefore the city has a historical value for croatia the serbs arrived almost years or so later but no the serbs should have krajina and kosovo according to the documentary is that fair to me it looks like double standards of morality from the director plus it is said in the documentary that the croatian constitution didn t have any laws about minority rights this is a lie because it was one of the first laws implemented because of the fact that croatia had a huge serbian minority the film mentions a radical croatian paramilitarian leader called glavas or the muslim radical oric they accused them of being a huge reason for the negative development of the war yes they were radicals but if you want to talk about radicals why not also mention the serbian radical paramilitary leaders such as seselj and arkan the flaws are so many that i just presented a few of them just so that people get an overview of the documentary it looks like the people who made this documentary weren t well prepared and didn t have the guts to criticize the serbs because they were afraid that their serbian relatives would slap them or something there aren t that many documentaries out there that are of good quality but the best so far is the death of yugoslavia where all the significant participants of the war are interviewed e g milosevic jovic bulatovic tudman izetbegovic karadzic etc and where you get a whole hour explanation about the fall of yugoslavia and the war one other thing i saw a comment on this documentary where the person was frustrated about why the us gave support to a country bosnia that had connections with bin laden during the war well first of all all the countries involved in this conflict had nationalist presidents and because the bosnian muslims didn t have an old ethnic identity previosly they were called muslim croats they had to rely on something else besides nationality to raise the spirit among the people and that was by connecting them to the only thing that they had in common: their religion and they took help from the mujahedin because no one else would support them they had to fight the :th largest army in europe they needed all the help they could get nationalism is the best way to unite a people during war history has shown us that 	NEG
let s just say it in simple words so that even the makers of this film might have a chance to understand: this is a very dumb film with an even dumber script lame animation and a story that s about as original as thumbtacks don t bother -- unless you need to find some way to entertain a group of mentally retarded adults or extremely slow children they might laugh especially if they re off their meds there s a special kind of insult in a film this ridiculous -- not only do the filmmakers apparently think that children are brainless idiots who can be entertained with claptrap that cost approximately zero effort but they don t even bother to break a sweat inserting a gag here and there that an adult might find amusing this film frankly ticked me off royally shame on you for stooping so low 	NEG
this is a strange sex comedy because there`s very little comedy but a whole lot of sex most of which takes place in the back of a car and is so graphic it makes basic instinct look like an edition of teletubbies i kid you not the sex in this film is so in your face it might just choke you especially if you`re watching with your grandparents as for the rest of rita sue and bob too there`s not much else worth mentioning except the language where every single sentence seems to contain the f word this a rather bleak hyper-realist british film made at a time when channel was the main investor in british movies which explains its made for television low budget feel	NEG
words fail me and that isn t common done properly this could have been great funny spoof b-movie sci-fi but sadly it was not to be rarely in the field of drama have so many competent actors struggled so vainly with such a dogs-breakfast of a script i can only endorse the previous reviewer s comments - go clean the bathroom in fact do anything except watch this film positives: lucy beeman s nose negatives: everything else most apposite line: this isn t going anywhere if only every plastic surgeon could meet with such a fate 	NEG

this may be the worst show i ve ever seen aside from the tastelessness of having a sitcom about hitler it just isn t funny or entertaining in any way it is very similar to a s sitcom in its cornball humor and contrived situations but while it can be well done like in i love lucy it s just not funny here i think the show was based around the novelty look it s hitler as a bumbling sitcom figure but it just fell flat in every regard the guy playing hitler is so hammy that its hard to sit through that alone i wonder what could have possibly made the network think this was a good idea to air i thought america had some tasteless show but the brits had us beat this time america would never air a sitcom about hitler although we did have that show about lincoln s slave the secret diary of desmond pfeiffer chances are you ll probably never see this show since it only aired one episode and will probably never be released on dvd 	NEG
this film reminds me a lot of the anti-drug films of the s and s due to the fact that it was made by people that have obviously never experienced the social evil that they are warning us about tom hanks and his buddies are role playing but there are no dice lots of candles and then you are just swept away in a bad montage showing hanks falling for the lady in the group quite funny but misguided i wonder how many poor kids had their d&d stuff destroyed and were told that the use of their imagination was the road to destruction as a film it s basically an after school special bad acting although hanks does show some of his talent and relationship talks and no one seems to be having any fun it seems these films have a psychological focus on adolescents starting on the road to adultism which is more serious apparently and requires you to buckle down and do the things everyone else does despite my vote of this is worth watching due to its unique genre scare films which i personally find quite funny 	NEG
how in the name of all that s holy did this film ever get distribution it looks as if it has been shot on someone s mobile phone and takes the screaming girl victim scenario to whole new depths they literally scream for the full minutes of the movie and that s all they do there is no plot no tension no characters and not a lot of acting just screaming and more screaming i gave up after fifteen minutes and fast-wound through it to see if anything happened it doesn t - except for screaming of course odlly enough the act of going through it on fast forward highlights another problem - there is no camera-work to speak of every shot looks like every other shot - middle distance one angle dull dull dull it s not so bad it s good it s just plain bad 	NEG
i almost never comment on movies but i saw the glowing reviews of this movie and decided i had to weigh in with my own review an instructor of mine received this film in the mail mixed in with his academy screeners ampas aka the guys who vote on the oscars and was so floored with how terribly constructed this movie was that he brought it in to our class to demonstrate to us how not to put together a movie this film has no plot the scenes are horribly horribly edited oftentimes using faux style picture-in-picture techniques and the performances particularly the lead who even fails at acting like a bad actress are for the most part obnoxious someone truly failed to understand the point of an introduction namely the setting up of the plot there is no setup halfway through the movie neither myself nor the rest of the class knew what this movie was supposed to be about the opening crane shot which sets up some kind of murder is never addressed and now that i think about it was possibly meant to be a flash-forward with the rest of the film being a flashback but it cuts from that scene directly to the next without any indication as such bah i could really go on and on at the very least this movie gives me renewed confidence in my own film-making ability 	NEG
this movie features a gorgeous brunette named danielle petty she has stunning green eyes and is in the first few scenes and the last scene she is the only thing about this movie that is not repulsive she may not have a future as an actress because this kind of movie is the kind of offensive disaster that kills careers the movie itself has absolutely nothing to recommend it it is not a good horror film or a good fake journalistic report or remotely well done there is no skill apparent in it s production it is like a bad student film the story s horrific elements do not make you sick it is the fact that it is so poorly done that makes you sick i would give this movie zero stars if i could 	NEG
absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever seen the acting the dialog the manuscript the sound the lighting the plot line i actually can t say anything positive about this although i enjoy swedish movies the fighting scenes are so ridiculous that it s impossible to take it seriously and when the lead character just happens to loose his shirt while dodging bullets in a strip bar i m not sure if it s supposed to be a joke or if someone really thinks these are ingredients in a good film regina lund is the only half descent actor but she disappears in a flood of laughable pronunciations and unbelievable reactions it leaves you horrified that someone actually spent time and money on something like this 	NEG
you do realize that you ve been watching the exact same show for eight years right i could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co-exist on an island but you d think that after watching unkempt stink-ladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original and interesting and i m not even speaking of the shows validity which for the record i find questionable it s just hard to suspend disbelief for bushy bill eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air conditioned make-shift bio-dome sipping frosty mochcinno s with moxy what s the appeal here i don t care about these people or their meandering lives i just don t get it but if you do find yourself being captivated by hairy unwashed people i suggest you turn off your tv and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their true habitat they call them homeless people and free of charge you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters eventually striking pay-dirt and fashioning a homemade dr frankenstein-styled cancer-stick all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of aqua velva on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise and the best part much like survivor every week one member of the tribe leaves the island when they are unceremoniously sent packing to the local institution when the frightening unmedicated state of full-blown schizophrenia kicks into gear now that s entertainment 	NEG
stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so so i am happy to see any of their films basically a man at a horn factory is the fourth to crack and soon enough ollie cracks with all the horn noises he is resting at home with stan by his side needing quiet and the doctor james finlayson phones to say he is coming over to check on ollie after realising plumbing and electricity is muddled up by a cross-eyed repairman the doctor comes in for a check-up and after some tests he recommends drinking goat s milk and getting some sea air on the ocean after stan practises some trumpet playing hanging out the window by the phone cord and a car crash he and ollie to a dock to rent a boat they keep the boat on the dock trying to milk a goat and stan has brought his trumpet meanwhile the newspaper s front page reads that killer nick grainger - escaped convict richard cramer has escaped and he sneaks onto the boys boat while they are sleeping and the goat chews through the boat rope drifting out to sea in the morning the see their location and the killer comes out demanding something to eat and he spots stan and ollie making fake food e g string for spaghetti soap for cheese belt for bacon sponge for meatballs and he forces them to eat it when ollie starts choking on something stan blows his trumpet to help and ollie s rage gets him punching the killer and it keeps going till the police arrive only to have ollie s rage get them put in prison too there were the tiniest moments of comedy but it isn t a great black and white film well here s another nice mess you ve gotten me into was number on years quotes and stan laurel and oliver hardy were number on the comedians comedian okay 	NEG
crude some times crass - to me that s the summation of madhur bhandarkar s latest work - page he has no point of view - just shallow funny digs at stereotypes what is the movie about is it about reporting a clan of people so called page types who are so busy socializing and progressing their profiles in life - that they have no time for anything else and you are either in it or out of it is it that there is no press at all to report everyday incidents madhur bhandarkar forgets that there is a main newspaper and page is just a supplement; perhaps an entertainer for checking out who s who and what s what don t mix the two and then there is power play - that would happen in every walk of life so what have you told at the end of it all - nothing - just a few crude jokes strung together in an otherwise direction less movie 	NEG
this film is regarded by some as a classic - i ve no idea why it is terrible to the point of being laughable the only saving grace with this movie are the delivery of cheesy lines that are so toe curlingly embarrassing that you have no choice but to laugh at them there are a couple of good songs and good choreography in this film but so what there is no plot it is set in a theatre with no change of scenery and michael douglas is as depressing as ever my brother once forced me to watch this film because he said i wouldn t believe how bad a film can get he was right normally with a film this dreadful i would recommend that people shouldn t watch it but in this case i think people should as it will put every other bad film you ve seen in perspective 	NEG

dear me where do i start the dad isn t anywhere near old enough to be the girl s dad he corpses on camera in the first minutes of the film the favoured exclamation in this film is jesus christ zombies are agile stupid and few and far between motives are utterly incomprehensible and a narrative does not exist people rush to their destination in jeeps driven at mph the world seems to be carrying on as normal yet these are supposed to be the end days breasts appear for the sake of breasts normally such an approach would provide some redemption but the rest of the film actually made me uninterested in breasts or the future of humanity there s a dog for no reason and thin orange blood that turns the stomach the general and his catchphrase of shut the f k up is the only redeeming feature as for the rest i sincerely hope to hear that they had done the decent thing and killed themselves 	NEG
i bought this from blockbuster for p the guy behind the counter said the reason it was so cheap was because the disc was scratched to sh t but failed to mention that the reason it was so cheap was because the film was a p ss poor effort that sucked harder than paris hilton in a hotel room home video talking of home videos since when has it been fair game to release them as films - i mean to say films used to employ actors and technicians and scriptwriters and so on - not any more - just gather your friends and lame-o ideas together for the weekend lavish the production with an £ budget and get someone to fall down the stairs with a casio keyboard the soundtrack - then slap it on the shelves for some poor sap me to take home in lonely desperation but here s the clincher - i fast forwarded through most of this and tossed it to one side ready for the hammers until the next night while watching a darren day horror hellbreed £ to take home and keep from a different blockbuster now this film made grim weekend look like the exorcist so i slapped grim weekend back on to catch up on some of the moments listed on the wonderful imdb boards that viewers claimed were hilarious sure enough once i had got over the misery the pain and the horror of realising grim weekend was utter chod on toast i could enjoy savour and downright get down to the funny stuff and there s a lot of it check the boards then check the flick hell it might even be worth it awwwww crap 	NEG
i remember when this was in theaters reviews said it was horrible well i didn t think it was that bad it was amusing and had a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor concerning families around holiday time ben affleck is a rich guy who needs to find a family for christmas to please his girlfriend he goes to visit the house he grew up in and strikes a deal to rent the family there for christmas i really liked the lawyer scene where they sign a contract that was funny so he makes silly requests of the family and even writes scripts for them to read of course the family has a hot daughter for the love interest and he learns that the holidays aren t so bad after all also the whole doo-dah act was funny especially when they replaced the first one with a black guy and the girlfriends s parents didn t even say anything about it and the parts where doo-dah is hitting on his supposed daughter final verdict: i thought it s worth checking out if you catch it on cable 	NEG
i couldn t wait to put this movie in my dvd player when i rented it then after i started it i couldn t wait to get it out of my dvd player actually i watched all of the movie my wife and i kept waiting and waiting for something funny to happen but nothing funny ever does the box read like the it would be really funny the premise of the movie sound good ben stiller is funny jack black is funny how could this movie miss well it does miss this is the unfunniest comedy i have ever watched nobody i have talked with thought it was even slightly funny it is just a really lame movie trust me avoide it avoide it 	NEG
i watched this today partially attracted to the all-star cast and partly because i have enjoyed so many other films of this ilk however this is one to avoid there are dozens of badly cut scenes where the continuity just does not flow the billiards challenge at the start for example the fighting scenes with the natives are about as good as you would remember in those old black and white tarzan movies you know where you see a spear fly through the air and camera cuts to a dead native lying motionless on the floor with it sticking from his thigh is that instantaneous death there are also several quite unnecessary scenes which have nothing to do with the plot like the little girl being rescued while collecting flowers the really badly animated clay toys are too painful to watch if you do see this movie the crabs which inch forward at about kph are the highlight somehow one manages to creep up on david mccullum and give him a nip its as if there was no time to get out of the way like when the obelisk in the city falls over the native has all the time in the world to take a step to the left but no he screams and it falls on him i only give this a because of ekland and why does mccullums voice develop a stutter as the movie progresses 	NEG
that is the best way i can describe this movie which centers on a newly married couple who move into a house that is haunted by the husband s first wife who died under mysterious circumstances that sounds well and good but what plays out is an hour of pure boredom in fact one of the funny things about this flick is that there is a warning at the beginning of the film that promises anyone who dies of fright a free coffin well trust me no one ever took them up on that offer unless someone out there is terrified of plastic skulls peacocks weird gardeners and doors being knocked on and the music is the worst it consists of constant tuba music which sounds like it is being played by some sixth grader and you will figure out the terrible secret that is so obvious that you really have to wonder what the people in this movie were thinking someone dies while running and hitting their head and the police are never called to investigate yes in the end this is a slow paced which is really bad considering the movie is only just over an hour boring little tale that is easily figured out by the average person apparently none of the characters in this flick were the average person 	NEG
ah yes the s a time of reaganomics and sly chuck and a host of other action stars hiding in a remote jungle blowing away commies at the time i couldn`t believe how movies like rambo missing in action and uncommon valor and who can forget the ridiculous red dawn made money at the box office they`re turgid action crap fests with a rather off putting right wing agenda and they have dated very badly troma`s war is a tongue in cheek take on these type of movies but you`ve got to ask yourself did they need spoofing in the first place of course not troma`s war lacks any sort of sophistication - though it does make the point that there`s no real difference between right wing tyrants and left wing ones - and sometimes feels more like a grade z movie than a send up maybe it is 	NEG
i was so excited and hyped up about watching this film when the promos first came out in november it looked awesome and the songs i was quite disappointed when i went to watch it this is a film which weaves couples together it has a multi cast of people a huge amount of stars have worked on this film i think the director nikhil advani has not managed the situation well and should not have had many people in this movie as this would of made it easier for him compared to nikhil s directorial debut kal ho naa ho salaam-e-ishq falls quite behind i think nikhil should have a smaller star cast i think the best factors of this film is the songs the songs are excellent and i think that all of the songs are awesome shankar-ehsaan-loy done an excellent job and have done an excellent jobs over the years i think the ratings of this movie may go up because of the excellent songs one thing i was disappointed with is that the director should not have included nudity in this film which is done by sohail khan and isha koppikar i found this extremely rude watching this with family although some may find this nude as comedy it is not something you would want to watch with parents i think the best acting was performed by salman and priyanka overall i think its an alright movie 	NEG
if you like films that are totally bizarre then this one is for you abdullah is one mean mother with a passion for strangling people and eating ham you should check this film out just for a laugh it is a low budget sci-fi musical comedy cannibalistic classic if you get bored of the film half way through you should persevere just for the sake of seeing the aliens which are nothing more than little toy robots but in my opinion are the films highlight i m the big meat eater pass me	NEG
the shirley jackson novel the haunting of hill house is an atmospheric tale of terror which conveys supernatural phenomena in an old mansion the atmosphere is well set out and the chills are staged well a haunting masterpiece the chiller the haunting stays closely to the book but also adds its own details to the plot fortunately these are very few and so the terror of the book and the chills are executed even better on the screen the black and white photography only adds to the creepiness of the movie excellent and then jan de bont made this in the remake of the haunting hit the cinemas - if you could call this a remake why they had to make a remake of the movie is a mystery in itself but for the moment lets look at the film itself it starts off averagely as most horror movies do the set used for hill house is beautiful and oddly mysterious and for a few minutes it seems as if the film is actually going to be quite a fair re-telling and then the first scare comes: a loose harpsichord wire slashes a woman s face dr marrow s assistant this is hilarious and truth be told it nearly had me in tears from then on the film just spirals downwards the acting seems to become somewhat wooden as the film goes on with owen wilson s character being particularly irritating so it s such a relief when he s decapitated by the flue the special effects practically make this movie which is a shame because most of them are incredibly cheesy and look very dated examples of these are many so i won t bother listing them so all in all i along with hundreds of others strongly recommend that you watch the original chiller or as an alternative buy the novel by shirley jackson but please stay away from this and if you do decide to watch this watch it on the tv as a lot of the channels love to screen this film and not the original or rent it cheap but please don t buy it whatever you do don t waste your money final rating: 	NEG
i just finished watching this movie and i found it was basically just not funny at all i m an rpg gamer computer type none of the dnd tabletop stuff but i found none of the jokes in this funny at all some of the scenes seemed to drag out a lot tilt and zoom could ve been cut down to seconds rather than over a minute and it feels as though the director was just trying to fill in time i think i laughed a total of - times in the entire movie the acting itself wasn t all that bad around the standard that a b grade movie should have i d suggest not bothering with this movie unless you re a huge dnd fan and even then it would probably be best to steer clear of it 	NEG
the more i analyze this film the worse it becomes first of all why a motivational speaker that part was just stupid i mean why would a megalomaniac trying to control the world rely on a motivational speaker is alexander stone really that disorganized first he can t decide what he wants to do to control the world so he looks to the bible for ideas many of these ideas i might add really have no reliability for example the part of the the houses of ishmael and isaac shall scream out in terror could have already happened it could have been have been the synagogues burned during krystalnacht and the mosques could very well have been the mosques blown up in baghdad or something and gillen lane s family they had no part except to provide a family values platfrom and dab their eyes with water i might add that since casper van dien gillen lane is only in his twenties or that s the impression that i had and has a ten year child he had his child during high school yeah there goes tbn s family values also why did this film have to be so damn propaganda-like i ll repeat what an earlier reviewer said the indiana jones flicks use christian mythology as a plot dvice and manipulate it well so that we are intoxicated this film doesn t do that the beginnig starts off well with michael ironsides playing a priest who murders a scholar off some sort and steals the dead guy s omega code then when confronted by two men who he is obviously afraid of the two prophets tell him tell your master that we are here dominic ironsides replies he already knows and points to a small surveillance camera that part sent chills up my spine had only it gone on like that one scene i would have loved this film i ll give michael york credit: he does a fine job of acting out his character as does michael ironsides but the good guys are horrible i ve already went on about lane s family now that i m over the acting i ll get on to plot this is obviously a baptist film since our beloved pope of the vatican is portrayed as an oaf the world domination plot i liked and found plausible and subtle as were the action sequences were also thrilling and well-done also another diatribe against the vatican their leaders are seen as dogmatically minded since gillen explains to the pope that it s not the end of the world but the beginning of a new one also the vatican or israelis says their going to secede from the world union aince they used the omega code to control the world whoever it was they wouldn t just secede they d send over commandoes and kill them this is the equivalent of america knowing about the kgb going to kill the president and simply saying we re not going to talk to you any more come on i did enjoy the scenes where we see bombers headed towards israel and see them again on the monitor mediocre in short 	NEG
a somewhat dull made for tv movie which premiered on the tbs cable station antonio and janine run around chasing a killer computer virus and that s about it for trivia buffs this will be noted as debuting the same weekend that the real life melissa virus also made it s debut in e-mail inboxes across the world 	NEG
in what could have been an otherwise run of the mill mediocre film about infidelity in the sixties the subtle free-love period the creators of this film pile on ridiculous scenario after ridiculous scenario and top it all off with a trite little cherry on top happily ever after ending at no time did i ever feel sympathy for diane lane or anna paquin in their troublesome middle-class care free life nor did i feel for the emasculated liev shrieber the story line plods along slowly to its predictable pathetic conclusion and the only thing interesting and watchable about this film is the stunning diane lane topless here s a hint it occurs about minutes into the film fast forward to that part and skip the rest 	NEG
do not see this movie if you value your mind at the end of our collective viewing me and my friends estimated that we each lost % of our brains during its course the only person involved with its making that was not clinically insane was the set designer most movies leave a bad taste in your mouth i realize now that instead of a feeling of revulsion this movie has bred a deep hatred within me i hate this movie so very very much some might say this movie is not meant to be taken seriously if only it didn t take itself seriously but it does the plot is a warmed over version of blade runner-esque universe melded with the cheap rubber suits so prevalent in bad dinosaur movies the dialogue is not only puerile and meaningless but often literally painful whoopee goldberg isn t even trying but george newbern as the voice of theodore rex is like fingernails on the soul and whether its juliet landua with her off again on again british accent or richard roundtree aka shaft as the blustering commissioner you will sink into an ever increasing sense of incredulity and disillusionment i recommend this movie only to anyone who wishes to see the depths of stupidity to which mankind may fall 	NEG
really they spelled it brain in the credits not brian ok they didn t have the budget for a spell checker all the production money went for great old cars there are at least two packards visible here one is a darin convertible a nice yellow packard convertible the scenes of the movie studio show that there was some money spent for costumes and set decorations old cameras an exterior of ciro s street signs and whatever was needed to make a visually pleasing picture was there poorly written and directed my dvd says it runs for minutes approximately it was more like minutes it came to an end without reaching a conclusion there was a collision but no conclusion the movie just smashed up against the credits cents for this i paid cents for this i could have bought cans of cat food and watched my cat s face as he emoted more excitement for a few seconds in the ciro s scene after darren mcgavin gets a phone call it looked like maybe this movie would have a surprise twist that would make for an interesting film then it just sat there the young latin actor played by steven bauer tony montoya could have had a much bigger part in all that was going on here this cast could have made a good film i think if they cut brian s part and use steven bauer in his place and change the script and keep the packards and lose the band and add a johnny otis sound alike band then they got something here kitty kitty tom willett	NEG
this film had a lot of promise and the plot was relatively interesting however the actors director and editors seriously let this film down i feel bad for the writers it could have been good the acting is wooden very few of the characters are believable who ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film there are lots of quick flashy edits in almost every scene which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying i wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no it left me feeling like i d wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money 	NEG
star rating: saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning long time inmate twitch kurupt gets himself transfered to a tougher prison than the re-opened alcatraz he claims it s to be closer to his lady but his real motives are a bit more grandiose there he crosses paths with burke bill goldberg a bulky prisoner who can take care of himself twitch despite being less muscular is just as mouthy and is pretty much the same but there is a gang war brewing between the black and hispanic inmates that explodes into a hostile takeover of the prison when the black s gang leader is shot dead and the finger points at burke but the sh t really hits the fan when the real killer and leader of the hispanics cortez robert madrid takes twitch s girlfriend and burke s daughter hostage steven seagal doesn t do sequels reportedly very opposed to the idea of under siege and only agreeing to do it on the condition the film company he was with at the time let direct his own movie so despite this being a dvd sequel the lead role this time round goes to bill golberg steve doesn t even appear in some of the stock footage from the first film that appears towards the end but there s a reason he hasn t done much work since universal soldier and that s because he s not much of an actor and not much of an action star either managing a character that begins as very dark and brooding but unsubtly turns into a standard action hero awkwardly quipping off dull one-liners support wise veterans from the first film kurupt and tony plana have merely jumped at the chance of extra work this is a film that s tried to copy the style of the original quite well with the dim lighting dark shadows and rap music playing over a lot of it it does this quite well unfortunately it can t contend with an unengaging hero an equally cardboard villain and an apathetic story that the makers do very much seem to have made up as they went along 	NEG
a previous reviewer said the movie is not all that bad what the movie glorifies child molestation oh but sylvia kristel was naked in it so let s give it out of stars why not a full because the filmography was agonizing the child s looks of shock were unrealistic and the fat friend was irritating nowhere in the review does the reviewer express any outrage that an american movie in featured scenes of a child having sex with a grown woman i happened to catch this steaming loaf of a movie while staying at a hotel that had showtime to me even if the fat friend had acted up a storm and was a deserving of an oscar i would still have to give the movie only star that tv s howard hessman starred in the movie at the same time as he was appearing in wkrp is particularly ridiculous but don t take my word for it 	NEG
wow simply awful i was a fan of the original movie and begrudgingly sat through part was and improvement and freddy s dead were pretty bad but nothing is as bad as freddy s nightmares freddy acts as a rod serlingesq host of this anthology series i can accept how freddy became one punchline after another but at least in the movies the appeal of freddy carried the movies but here these were so poorly made they looked like high school productions of a horror series the poor actors if you really want to call yourself that after doing this show were obviously exactly what they paid for i m nearly certain this was a stopping point for two types of actors ones just starting on the hollywood ladder brand new willing to take any part that would put off their having to take that porn job they were offered last week or seasoned actors on their way down the hollywood ladder willing to take any part that would put off their having to take that porn job they were offered last week i half expected dana plato to guest star but she was already dead by the time this was in production to paraphrase nancy s line in the original elm st what ever you do try not to fall asleep watching this 	NEG
the remake of h b halicki s classic seventies chase film is simply horrible along with vanishing point gone in seconds represent the quintessential car chase films the remake takes the original and stands it on its head whereas halicki gave us % car chase and % supporting drama in giss we get % car chase and % supporting drama cage as super man saves his brother kisses the girl mtv edits tits and ass save your money rent the original at least halicki didn t live to see his baby he wrote produced directed and starred in the film degraded in this manner 	NEG
like watching a neighbor s summer camp home movies indian summer is a sleep inducing bore eight alumni campers are barely introduced when unbelievably boring flashbacks begin for characters we know nothing about fine actors alan arkin and bill paxton are totally wasted in this film one camper s observation that everything seems so much smaller than i remember it is repeated at least ten times enough to make you squirm the anticipated pranks are neither funny or original unless you think that short sheeting is a real howler this movie was a great disappointment considering the ample talent involved indian summer did not make me homesick just sick - merk	NEG
i remember reading all the horrible horrible reviews for this film when it came out i meant to go see how horrible it was but it was out of theaters in three weeks the only other movie to manage that is gigli when the movie came out on dvd i bought it to see how awful it was i couldn t think of the sheer horrible attention that this film was getting was possible after seeing it i can understand first off let me say that this film is not without some cool shots there s a nice shot at the beginning that shows a bullet being fired from inside the gun which i thought was neat and the way the monsters in this movie die is sort of cool to look at; but it gets old after the first time you see it let me start with the worst thing in this movie: tara reid if bad acting was a sin then hell would ve chucked tara reid right out since she s so unbelievably awful in this movie it s unthinkable and of all the roles she plays a curator now if she played a dumb empty- headed sex toy then maybe i might be able to forgive her for how she treats her character apparently uwe boll didn t realize that although he did seem to think that if she took off her shirt in the movie people would see it he just didn t realize that making her do that in the middle of the film at the absolute wrong moment just made the movie even more hilariously bad and is that a mexican song or something during the scene of dry humping i couldn t tell which brings me to my next complaint: uwe boll shows off some of the worst directing skills you ll ever see in a movie i mean i d give house of the dead an f and i only do that for very few movies but hotd would score at least a b compared to this screwed up piece of junk the movie starts off with a very very long narration that causes immediate confusion and read by a horrible narrator and from there the cuts are really really dumb there s this one point where slater and reid are looking around a building that s been destroyed and the screen blackens out when it comes back slater and reid are shooting everywhere and suddenly an entire army has joined them huh and someone did not bother checking the mistakes in this movie at one point a team breaks through glass but the glass breaks before they touch it tara reid s earrings switch colors in the middle of one scene and after slater walks away from a dead comrade you can see her begin to get up as for the story i was really lost something about an old tribe releasing darkness and someone opens the path or something and all the evil monsters pop out it s just an excuse to have a lot of gun scenes the technology is so advanced here that no character ever needs to reload in this film that get quite simply boring i bought this movie hoping to laugh at how incredibly stupid it was i didn t laugh but i still think it s stupid very very very stupid 	NEG
how many centuries will pass until the japanese asian horror films abandon the long-haired ghost-woman shtick admittedly they ve managed to rip off ringu a million times and often it worked well - which just goes to show that originality isn t that much of a requirement in the horror genre or that i m very uncritical and easy to please however this time around i found myself a little restless somewhat bored it s not a bad film but it s at least half-an-hour longer than it should be with its absurd minutes length compared to many other japanese horror films omc lacks atmosphere and excitement plus the ending is confusing: it makes no sense at all as for the ring-tone: miike could have come up with a melody that is more effective than that forgettable little thing even though it was played a dozen times i can t even remember it - that s how scary it was speaking of miike for him this is something of a commercial venture so if anyone thinks they might be getting perversion of the bijita q or audition kind they re wasting their time 	NEG
unlike others i refuse to call this pitiful excuse for a movie a triumph of style over substance i don t want to give style a bad name still it s the most apt description that comes to mind a pointless unpleasant and ultimately meaningless assault on the eyes and ears wonderland leaves one wondering only why the film was made in the first place and who in their right mind gave the greenlight to this dreary and tangled mess a biography of porn star john holmes a study of who the man was why he went into the business and how it affected him great bound to be compelling bound to be entertaining bound to be enlightening and fascinating on about a million levels and i have zero interest in porn but a confusing violent rashomon-style study of a series of murders holmes was connected with after his career ended who in hell cares what insights do we gain this film completely ignores the most interesting aspect of john holmes s life -- that he was a porno star wonderland might as well have been about anyone: the fact that the main character is the most famous male adult film star in history is almost irrelevant to make matters about a thousand times worse the picture is loaded down with jerkoff gimmicks -- annoying machine gun editing sloppy dogme- camerawork unnecessary split-screen graphics and animation etc etc in the absence of a compelling story and unique main character the director and i use the term loosely has thrown together a dozen or so techniques from other films and decided to call the resulting mess a movie among these: the trendy bleach-bypass look of narc or traffic or minority report; the frantic often incomprehensible throw-the-pieces-of-film-in-the-air cutting style of natural born killers or days later; the fill-every-moment-of-silence-with- an-old-song-to-evoke-the-period soundtrack of goodfellas or blow; the groovy retro title sequence of velvet goldmine or autofocus or catch me if you can the list goes on and on and on pathetic i wanted to like this movie i had real hopes for it wonderland avenue had been around for years; had the context of the murders been emphasized rather than the murders themselves i think it could have worked had the murders and holmes s growing involvement with seedy l a types signaled the end of a career or the end of the swinging s i think the film could have had meaning; it could have served a purpose as it is -- meaningless pointless who cares how many perspectives exist on a series of murders generally unknown by the public the case isn t famous enough to merit such painstaking examination this film should have been the third act of the john holmes story that s it period and it could have worked what s that oh right right they didn t want to tell a traditional rise-and-fall story they didn t want to make boogie nights or goodfellas or star or autofocus they wanted their film to be different right well in one sense they succeeded there s a big difference between those films and wonderland the difference is those films are good 	NEG
i actually prefer robin williams in his more serious roles e g good will hunting the fisher king the world according to garp these are my favorite robin williams movies but seize the day although well-acted is one of the worst movies i ve ever seen and certainly the worst robin williams movie even worse than death to smoochy club paradise and alladin on ice every good story is going to have its ups and downs this movie however is one giant down i don t need a feel-good hollywood cheese-fest but i ve got to have something other than minutes of complete and utter hopelessness this movie reminds me of love liza which is actually worse because it seems that the only point of the movie is to see how far one person can fall the answer who cares 	NEG
i think phillip kaufman read the cliff s notes version of the kundera novel and then set about making this film okay of course it won t have the punch of the original kundera s novels are great because of his manipulation of the narrative concept his ability to step in and out of stories he constructs this film does not even try the one dream sequence of tereza s so vital to the atmosphere of the book is reworked and makes no sense whatsoever also and this is perhaps a lesser point daniel day-lewis looks a lot like ben stiller in this i know it s not really a valid complaint but hey a perfect example of the hollywood-izing of otherwise fine literature 	NEG
scary movie is definitely the worst of the films for there is not much of a plot bad acting pretty tedious and some really cheesy jokes but and this is a big but there is one good actor one good recurring joke and a good beginning the good actor being tim curry the one good recurring joke is the creepy weird butler with the disgusting hand who always does cringey but laugh worthy things and the good beginning is the spoof of the excorsist the plot to scary movie is the main characters from the original and a host of new characters along the way are invited to stay the night at a creepy old mansion but will they survive the night this film is not very good but if your bored you might as well watch it 	NEG
this is a baffling film the beauty in sexual relations between men and women is shown degraded by a set of men and women who can only be described as a collection of oddballs and misfits greenaway acknowledges his inspiration to fellini s film but whereas fellini is a titan of world cinema greenaway is not he has none of the maestro s lightness of touch nor his ability to convey feelings and emotions with a deftness of clarity he is pretentious the film being divided into chapters with a written introduction to each as if the viewer has to be guided into the film except that the written notices only stay on screen for a few seconds not long enough to be read by the audience with the result that they are mostly ignored as for the women only two can be described as lookers palmira played by polly walker and giaconda played by natacha amal the rest ooze with ordinariness both the women and the men retreat from the harsh light of reality into the dim shades of fantasy greenaway obviously wants to make the point that sexual fantasy does not lead to happiness the women themselves are depressing since they render their services in exchange for money relations between men and women are debased into a commercial transaction there is no sense of joy or happiness or love in the film indeed there are several scenes that are deeply unpleasant :the suggestion of an incestuous relationship between father and son philip and storey emmental played respectively by john standing and matthew delamere the callous disregard of both men that giaconda is carrying their child she in fact gets pregnant twice the first foetus being aborted and the second time she is sent away to a destination chosen by the men from a flight book both men having sex with a woman who has no legs the half woman in the title the beastiality that exists between beryl played by amanda plummer with a pig named hortense father and son sharing women between them women enjoying being beaten sexually the father sleeping with the corpse of his dead wife mercifully none of these scenes are shown sexually only hinted at the hinted degradation of women is such that there cannot be any wonder that the film was booed at when it was first premiered at cannes what is more extraordinary is that the actresses in the film lined up to defend it showing yet again that there is no limit to the naivety of women and that women will fool themselves into being exploited by men greenaway s directorial style is pretentious it is a triumph of style over substance a depiction of film as art accompanied by the abandonment of common sense greenaway tries to attain the sublimity of surrealism but only succeeds in showing the banality of human relationships 	NEG
truly one of the most dire films i ve ever sat through i ve never actually taken the time to write one of these but felt compelled to after witnessing this affront to film-making and feel somewhat aggrieved to be wasting my time on such a piece of turd to be honest there were so many parts that infuriated me with their complete randomness and lack of sense e g when would the police force ever shoot people with infectious diseases when would hospitals ever through out such people for lack of a cure why was the guy who spotted him spying on his wife wandering around outside in his dressing gown whilst carrying a gun as she rolled around on the bed also the characterisation - as we ve almost come to expect in such films - was awful e g the way the blonde guy - i don t remember his frickin name and don t give a toss anyway - completely turned against his girlfriend and ran off to leave her and i ended up wanting them all to meet grisly ends the production was horribly disjointed and the cinematography nothing to write home about 	NEG
i m sorry to all the fans but this is a useless movie the acting is bad even wooden it over-hypes the fright-factor early on and doesn t exactly work i think there was supposed to be a twist at the end but it just ended up being maddeningly confusing what the hell the dude who was killing everyone was one of the hunted try again its hardly original and it isn t even particularly good as a straight slasher and that s saying something i think whoever did the castings whoever wrote the script and whoever thought of the concept should be mercilessly fired and deported don t watch this movie if someone puts this on at a party throw the disc out the window and put on a good horror movie like silence of the lambs or the shining 	NEG
tashan - the title itself explains the nature of the movie this type of movies are actually made for flop what a shame that yash raj films produces such movies those are worthless than c-grade movies or even some c-grade movies have better and pleasing story than tashan the much hyped and over-confidently promoted tashan poorly bombed at the box-office which it certainly deserved in my view this is the worst movie ever made from honourable yash raj films banner how come they handled such a heavy project to new vijay krishna acharya who has no actual sense of making action flick he tried to imitate sanjay gadhvi s ways of making like dhoom but he suffered at last the action scenes are more like than comics or cartoon movies made for exhausting the audiences the story also loses in its meaning and substances to tenderly win the audiences hearts in most scenes anil kapoor reminds me of southern tamil star rajnikant in his body languages and wordly expressions i am not a fan of neither saif nor akshay but the award of kareena should have finally gone to saif s hand instead of akshay just from the starting point i expected of it but at the end it displeased me with the climax truth saif is the main behind the whole adventure while akshay joins in the midst in any movie the final should be judged with the whole characters of the entire story and the award or say reward should be given to the one who deserves credit and tashan loses in this way and unexpectedly failed to become a hit akshay s has nothing new to show off his comedian talent here but still reminds of his previous movies he seriously need to form a new image to his fans that would impress them again and again in between saif did a great job in race and now he returned again in his hilarious nature through this movie but he has fully developed himself in the acting field and last but not the least about kareena she looks really hot with bikini dress of which some complain as she became too lean but i myself don t think so instead she became slim yes slim it is a good factor for a female to attract the major people or say male beside them it is nice that saif s son ibrahim appears in the beginning & last as young saif i hope now he too will lean forward in target of making acting as his career those who like this tashan they are either mentally immatured or still want to go back to childhood or say want to be admitted in an asylum thumbs down to debutante director vijay krishna acharya who mishandled the project offered by yash raj films in future he should experiment and study the script minimum of years before going into practical directions sorry i don t like to rate good stars to this type of junk movies 	NEG
a splendid example of how hollywood could and still can take a masterpiece of literary fiction and stupidly foul it up in the case of the big sky writer dudley nichols and company arrogantly assumed they could improve upon a classic pioneer novel by the pulitzer prize-winning author a b guthrie in so doing they removed the soul of the story and any edge and impact it may have had as a film adaptation the epic nature of guthrie s book and the evolution of its main character boone caudill from a naive kentucky lad into a hardened and competent survivor mountain man has been replaced with a downscaled riverboat farce that bears little resemblance to the author s intent in the movie version boone s presence is nothing except underwhelming intriguing and even shocking plot elements that give guthrie s novel impact and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason whatsoever most puzzling of all is the emphasis placed upon the zeb calloway character who was an incidental minor character in the book only occupying a handful of pages on the other hand a very important and fascinating character dick summers the veteran pioneer is missing altogether it is also apparent that director hawks decided the zeb character in the movie played by actor hunnicutt wasn t irritating enough so zeb hunnicutt was given a significant amount of time doing that obnoxious voice-over narration that is the hollywood short cut for incompetent screen writing editing and direction some movies have actually improved upon the books upon which they were based william wyler s ben-hur is an excellent example but this is horrible and depressing not only as an adaptation of a novel but as a film unto itself the story is dull and clichéd and the characters - at least the ones that have not been edited out of the script - are just shallow and boring shadows of guthrie s literary vision and unfortunately kirk douglas star appeal which could have helped lift this film was scuttled by the milktoast role he was given if you can believe it the film version of guthrie s pulitzer prize-winning sequel the way west also starring kirk is even worse in my opinion the big sky further solidifies howard hawks place as one of the most overrated tepid directors in the history of cinema 	NEG
the film is about a young man michael who cares for the elderly one day he decides to kill some of the relatives of his clients around the same time he decides to model his killing after the zodiac killer of the s he gets in touch with the author of a book about the zodiac killer and they form a friendship michael has a gun aparently the only gun as it seems to be in the hands of some of the other actors only not portrayed as the same gun and he goes out a-killin original this is a great film if you like b movies i thought the idea of the movie was good but the editing and the acting really drowned the plot i thought the blood was just too fake the lighting was horrible in some places and the dialog was just too standard the movie was shot on video which is okay but the editing of the film just made for some weird plan scenes not a bad movie for fans of the b-movie genre but if you want something with a bit more polish move on to something else 	NEG
i don t know why i keep doing this to myself i keep on defending the dutch and belgian cinema and claim that it should get more credit and chances and then they smack you around the head with junk like this intensive care is a terrible production and probably the worst thing that was ever made in the dutch-speaking countries it s a dutch attempt to create our very own horror franchise clearly based on mainstrain american slasher classics such as friday the th and halloween the producers and writers aimed really high with this but fell really low intensive care became an embarrassing product to everyone who was involved and therefore a true cult flick here it s almost impossible to hunt down an original copy of this and it s only showed on special occasions like the night of distaste for exactly minutes intensive care tries to tell a story and even to create a plotline then it changes into a lame and low-brain slash n stalk movie with gruesome - yet very hilarious and cheap - make up effects the acting of the entire cast is abominable even though there are a few respected names involved the leading male role is played by koen wauters this guy might as well be the most famous and loved artist in belgium he s a beloved singer host of tv-shows and idol of many young girls he never ever mentions this thing he starred in though like everybody else in the netherlands he s trying to convince himself intensive care never happened 	NEG
first off i must stress how rare it is that i take the time to comment on a movie that i have seen it takes a very special case for me to take the time and write about how i felt about a film that said of the hundreds of movies i have watched i have seen some of the most brilliant shawshank the scariest the woman in black the funniest shark attack iii: megaladon and now the worst: vampires vs zombies the first thing that must be said is that this movie is not funny for those that are looking for a light hearted movie that will just be fun or at the very least so bad that it s funny look elsewhere it is true that a movie such as this is not trying to be subtle and brilliant with a title such as this you should know what you re getting into that said there is no excuse for a movie to abandon any and every rule that governs the movie making world this is not an argument between the traditional movie making process and newer and more artsy methods to creating a film this is an argument between bad directors and companies being held accountable for making terrible movies this movie suffers from the over used saying i don t know where to start truly everything about this movie is broken from the acting and to the editing there is no reason any movie should ever fail to deliver a cohesive series of events such as vampires vs zombies some of the following problems are; scene misfires- it s clear that the director the camera crew and the actors were not on the same page in one scene in particular the scene begins with the camera resting on the ground looking at the passenger side door of a car you are expecting the person inside to get out but there is a and this is no exaggeration second at least delay between the camera comes on and the director says action to where anything happens on screen the viewer is left staring at a car door for the entire time with no sound no movement just the stereotypical dead air that radio or tv commentators dread where was the editing acting- a forgivable offense in most cases you can t expect a movie like this to have oscar winners after all but vampires vs zombies takes bad acting to a whole other level these actors were barely able to read their scripts obviously because anyone with any ability to read and to speak would have been able to pronounce the lines better than these fools my only comparison for acting would have to be the opening scene from resident evil on playstation but that acting was even better - story- wait what story again you can t expect this to be the greatest story ever told but is it too much to ask that we have some semblance of a narrative why the vampires who are the characters who are the bad guys are there good guys why all the lesbians but most importantly what s the deal with the zombies if you have seen this movie then you will understand what i mean but to those who haven t i ll be plain there are no zombies in this movie aside from maybe five minutes of it it was almost as if the director forgot about the name of the movie and was forced to throw some zombies in without explanation at the very end there s so much more but i hope i ve done enough to keep anyone from seeing this movie 	NEG
it s hard to criticize this movie because i dislike the story itself and no amount of good acting would have saved it think raising arizona with a mean streak the acting is passable but jennifer tilly is way over the top yet not enough to make this a nice camp film as usual coming in somewhere between misery and a sarcastic dmv employee the rest of the cast have their brows perpetually knitted in consternation either from the stress of their parts or the stress of the whole futile exercise a real degrading few hours of film darryl hannah spends most of the movie weeping too hard to be understood i wish i could tell you how it ended but i walked out sorry 	NEG
all internet buzz aside this movie was god awful i expected the movie to be more of a farce than anything instead the film makers tried to make a serious thriller horror movie and they completely missed there were only a few good parts and a couple good lines by samuel jackson other than that it was a bunch of gore and some poorly animated snakes all of the internet joking was miles better than the actual movie now that the movie has actually come out hopefully this joke will die don t waste your time or money on this piece of over hyped trash if you re looking for something that s funny and entertaining then just go to snakes on a blog 	NEG
quite possibly the worst movie that i have ever seen when has hollywood ever made a successful movie that attacked republicans why don t they learn the dixie chicks haven t these lefties live in their own elite bubble interacting among themselves; oblivious to the fact that most of america is much further right than they are the best hollywood productions are not partisan and are rarely political at all dan akroyd s imitation of cheney was bad i would have thought cussack could have landed better movies it wasn t funny 	NEG
i have never panned a film on-line but i felt moved to do so after seeing this one one doesn t show up at someone s funeral and say to the bereaved my relatives died so why should i care about yours minus the propaganda there was little if anything that could be called art as the daughter of deaf parents i was particularly annoyed by the use of deafness as a gimmick any deaf person feeling a vibration of that immensity would likely have investigated not ignored it the word chutzpah comes to mind as a writer there are few subjects i would stay away from: the holocaust is one; this is another i wish these movie makers had not been so arrogant and inept 	NEG

this movie was just terrible the first movie wasn t that great i mean it s ridiculously stupid if they didn t have enough with the first films you had to add another one why just not make this into an ongoing series like james bond i ll tell you exactly why because the bond films are actually very very good and these films just stink i don t understand was this supposed to be a cross between to genres like horror and comedy for goodness sakes my year old niece wouldn t be scared of such a ridiculous attempt at horror a spit in the face of people who at least want to be scared at some point in a so called horror film please no more of these movies 	NEG
some might say something like baby geniuses with its giant robot infants or dumbo with its psychedelic drug-addled nightmare sequence would win the award for the most disturbing movie ever made for children you might say that too but you d be wrong lo and behold for i bring to you: santa claus the most helplessly messed up family film since well ever from the opening scenes showing children from different parts of the world singing their insipid theme songs seriously this segment is nearly freakin minutes long and has nothing to do with the plot to the thrilling conclusion in which merlin pops up from outta nowhere and saves the day don t mind him he s from barcelona this is childhood trauma at its finest and no matter how hard i try no matter how many different therapists i visit i just can t get those reindeer s laughter out of my head avoid this mind-bending piece of trash like you d avoid a sex-starved whale during mating season still if flaming gay demons with a serious case of the overacting flu are something for you i guess you should give it a try but really this movie isn t worth your time and mental health 	NEG
a complete waste of timehalla bol is a complete waste of time the script and dialogues are poorly written the direction is lacklustre and the acting borders on hammy this movie was clearly aiming for the rang de basanti crowd but it falls far short of the mark because it does not have even one of the elements that made rdb connect with its audience_great script terrific acting good direction and a powerful social message that was never preached but shown compared to that near-masterpiece halla bol takes a step backwards by resorting to scenes such as the hero taking a leak on the villain s persian rug and the hero s mentor staring down bullets in a truck no less all of this might have been acceptable in the s when there was a downturn in movie quality and bad movies like divyashakti and phool aur kaante became big hits but movie-making has become_should have become_more subtle and thoughtful of late rajkumar santoshi is a capable director and i appreciate that he wants to give a social message in every movie he makes but maybe he simply does not know how to do it he resorts to sermonizing without a care as to the audience s intelligence in understanding what he is trying to say maybe he should just concentrate on entertainment and leave the social messages to the rakeysh mehras and aamir khans even if you don t agree with everything i say you will agree that throughout the screening you will be thinking that rang de basanti was much much better and mr santoshi should have left the industry-bashing to om shanti om industry-bashing that s right santoshi has depicted the industry as a place of back-biting bitching and the casting couch which the hero happily indulges in with a starlet curiously named sania there are some people who will think that these portions show the real face of the industry don t believe everything you see all in all raise your voice against movies like this and don t spend your hard-earned money on this bomb out of 	NEG
this is almost like two films--one literate and engaging the other stupid and clichéd it s really a shame all the problems weren t worked out with the writing but considering how quickly most b-movies were written and produced this isn t too unusual it s a real shame though as this could have been a very good film first the good the movie is original and involves wwii code-breakers this is pretty fascinating and i liked watching the leading man lee bowman go through his paces as a master code-breaker in fact the first two-thirds of the film was very good but now for the bad the film just went on way too long and lost steam at about minutes additionally jean rogers role as the kooky girlfriend must rank as one of the worst-written and distracting roles in film history for every smart move made by bowman the idiot rogers then stepped in to screw things up as some sort of misguided comedy relief if her role had been intelligently written the overall film would have improved immensely instead watching her it s hard to understand how we actually won wwii 	NEG
if there s one thing you can count on disney to do it s their uncanny ability to take a story and tell it again and again and again even watching the commercial for lady and the tramp ii was a horrible experience disney s going to ruin one of their most awesome classics ever it even had that spaghetti meatball scene it s been done before and that s what i say to this sorry direct to video the entire concept should be banned everything is just a rehash of the original movie and even several of bluth s really bad movies the penguin and walrus duo i ve even forgotten their names are just a really poor carbon copy of timon and pumbaa morgana is another ursula she even repeats practically all her old lines the songs are pathetic really abysmal i ve never heard songs so bad from them before until now and the dialogue is atrocious it s pathetic and simplistic on the plus side at least they took the time to make the animation somewhat decent all of the usual characters aren t as annoying as they used to be or maybe that s a minus for little mermaid fans back on the negative melody is just so sickeningly cute you just might vomit i almost did do yourself and your little mermaid fan a favor don t waste your money on this true it s not as horrific as return of jafar or pocahontas ii but that s little consolation 	NEG
star rating: saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning alice having defeated freddy at the end of the last film is now trying to re-adjust her life but her unborn child is carrying a demonous presence- freddy trying to come out into their world again it s interesting to note the directors who got their big breaks directing freddy films- charles russell eraser the mask renny harlin the long kiss goodnight cutthroat island cliffhanger die hard and here stephen hopkins lost in space predator but while russell and harlin made a good job of it hopkins imo has made something of a podge with this entry that should be quickly forgotten the story is clearly being stretched as far as it can go here with freddy ludicrously a father himself and the ridiculous looking demon baby even at about an hour and a half it all gets rather tiresome and of course not scary at all the bon appetit bitch catch-phrase is the only memorable point of this other wise very forgettable entry 	NEG

for some reason tv guide gave this two and a half stars plus faye dunaway is in it so it definitely looked like something to see my oh my this may be the worst film i ve ever seen ever from its horrid acting every time the girl asks the boy what s wrong with him i shouted to the tv i can t act when she asks what he needs i yell i need acting lessons to the unbelievably bad dialog give me back my organs and the brian depalma wannabe ending too it was all just beyond awful i wanted to like it dunaway is one of the best actors ever and the production values were pretty good but wowzers this had me laughing laughing most of the time don t even bother out of curiosity that was my first mistake staying with it was definitely my second and third and fourth 	NEG
even with a cast that boasts such generally reliable names as val kilmer and lisa kudrow wonderland fails to yield any sense of depth to this film it barely brushes the surface of the incidents that happened on that july night in kilmer just goes through the motions as john holmes and kudrow and kate bosworth are both hopefully miscast in the other two lead roles; as holmes s wife and underage girlfriend respectively the rest of the cast has such small roles that it s impossible to get any dimensions from them the film also stars carrie fisher ted levine franky g mc gainey dylan mcdermott and a cameo from paris hilton 	NEG
you know jason you know freddy and you know leatherface now get ready for: the safety pin killer that s right in killer workout a dumb slasher movie if i ve ever seen one the unseen murderer dispatches his or her victims with an oversized novelty safety pin it is an odd choice to be sure the kind of thing that deserves an explanation naturally the movie never even attempts to clarify where the killer acquired such a thing as the title suggests an aerobics gym is under siege by a mad killer and everyone is a suspect in fact the movie gives so few clues as to the identity of the killer just about everyone in the movie is a potential murderer until they get killed and since just about everyone but the killer winds up dead it s really just process of elimination oddly while the entire name cast is killed off the aerobics classes continue in earnest in fact nothing is capable of stopping the dancing while three men are murdered in the next room the workout goes on death isn t even a factor; one character dies but is still seen prominently in the later workout sessions director david prior knew what he was doing when named the movie killer workout and not logical workout cop chases explosive tanning beds and hundreds of shots of women s exposed flesh are thrown in for good measure much like the woman caught in the tanning bed i felt very uncomfortable by the end of killer workout finally thankfully the end flashed on the screen what happened next you got it shots of the women working out not even the end of the movie can stop them 	NEG
its not the cast a finer group of actors you could not find its not the setting the director is in love with new york city and by the end of the film so are we all woody allen could not improve upon what bogdonovich has done here if you are going to fall in love or find love manhattan is the place to go no the problem with the movie is the script there is none the actors fall in love at first sight words are unnecessary in the director s own experience in hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set it is reality to him and his peers but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world so in the end the movie is hollow and shallow and message-less 	NEG
if you want to watch a good film about how women can fight back against sexual assault then this film is not the film that you want to watch it was a social commentary about a woman who was victimized and fights back spoiler: rosario dawson turns the tables on her assailant instead of using the criminal justice system the victim resorts to using vigilantism she in essence nullifies the judicial system the film the accused was a much better film because the victim uses the judicial system and wins what the descent does is telling victims of assault that they should resort to violence is victim any better that the accuser no 	NEG
this film is a pia zadora special when viewing it i was reminded of the classic cartoon showing a hollywood starlet; in urgent need of another role but afraid of becoming typecast for b movie or soft porn roles; who says at her casting session well of course i do not normally do roles requiring nudity but if it is artistically necessary for the film this recollection brought up a very naughty image of a similar cartoon showing pia at such a session saying well of course i do not normally take any roles requiring actual acting but if it will really give me sufficient exposure to enhance my status as a sex symbol this is probably grossly unfair the rather sordid tale is the fault of harold robbins book; considering the nature of the story pia s exposures certainly do not receive undue attention and perhaps pia who once won an acting award in butterfly is deliberately satirising her part rather than attempting to act in an almost unplayable role critics usually point first to the actors as the problem whenever a film proves disappointing but this is grossly unfair; the scriptwriters and director are far more often the guilty parties the real problem with the lonely lady is that the screenplay like the original book looks for sensation rather than substance and nothing can help with this the screenplay for this film is abysmal but whether the story could have been filmed more successfully with a better script tauter directing and really competent acting must remain a matter of personal judgement as it was released my viewers rating for it would depend upon whether i am assessing my personal opinion or assessing to what extent the film succeeds in providing what it aims at doing my personal rating for it would be two out of ten; but to some extent this film probably provides exactly what its sponsors intended and judged on this basis a quality rating of four out of ten would be reasonable being in a charitable mood and wanting to make it clear that i am not blaming pia for my disappointment i will give an imdb rating of four 	NEG
there just isn t enough here there a few funny spots but not really enough i was very disappointed because i love stupid movies i was expecting this to be a hidden gem it was not it was a hidden turd the whole time i was watching it i was thinking geez i could do better than that and i m a moron don t believe the few good reviews i was suckered in by them at no point did i laugh at loud maybe this was funny or cutting edge in but man it fell flat today this movie had promise it just didn t deliver on it maybe if they rewrote it a few more times i cant fault the actors they weren t the best but they just didn t have much with which to work this movie failed because of threadbare writing sorely disappointed 	NEG
i can say nothing more about this movie than: man this sucks if you really hate yourself and want to do some severe damage to your brain watch this movie it s the best cure in the world for taking away happiness when i started watching this film i was completely happy afterwords i could feel my brain melting like it was struck by molten lava god i hate that stupid dinosaur so if you want severe brain damage: watch this movie it will do the trick 	NEG
i concur with everyone above who said anything that will convince you to not waste even a briefest of moments watching this amazingly amateurish movie very poor acting offhand production values utterly pedestrian direction and a script so inept and inane it should never have been written let alone produced even hollywood professionals apparently go to work just for a paycheck although no one should have been paid for this bad work careers should instead have ended over this inconsequential drivel oth there is something fascinating about watching something so jaw-droppingly bad and chad lowe is terrifically and consistently bad 	NEG
so altogether i found this documentary to be strange and really pointless i know it got awards and things but i personally did not enjoy it too much there was no humor or drama in it to keep you interested just a bunch of wierdos and their jobs some of the people in are rather different which isn t a bad thing it just didn t leave a good impression on me i was thoroughly bored by this movie no offense to my creative writing teacher the circus theme throughout the whole movie was kinda cool but i didn t get it and robotics and lion taming is definitely not my thing the green animals thing was neat i really liked the garden lots of colorful flowers but how did these four jobs connect it just didn t make much sense to me why someone would make a movie about that but if you are into stuff like this you might enjoy it who am i to stand in your way i am just forewarning you about possible suffering 	NEG
revenge on us the viewing public perhaps i sat through this hour movie and i was waiting for the second act to kick in so that the movie lived up to its title but costner never avenges his lovers fate she dies and the movie ends i was left wondering where the rest of the movie was if a movie is called revenge then the hero better get some by the end of the film i had a choice of seeing this or black rain at the cinema thankfully i saw the other brothers movie at the cinema instead i caught up with this turkey on video there was one good thing about the film and was its beautiful theme tune listen to the cd dont watch this its awful out of 	NEG
while not as bad as it has been made to be i have seen much worse this is still a very lame movie basically a rehash of siegel s coogan s bluff with the main difference being that clint eastwood s hat has more charisma than the whole of joe don baker an unappealing actor if there was one however venantino venantini is great and great fun as the bad guy sort of a budget vittorio gassman he is the main reason to sit through this steampile as the rest of the cast deliver mostly terrible acting specially the girl poor old rossano brazzi hard to believe he was once a romantic lead watch mondo cane to see him running away from women looking here like a second-tier ben gazzara he s given next to nothing to do it s all joe don s show unfortunately and all of it scored to generic s action movie music that couldn t be more boring greydon clark can make good b-movies without warning but here he trips falls breaks his nose and loses three teeth well at least the malta locations were nice and there s venantini to try to save the day 	NEG
i ve tried to watch this show several times but for a show called that s show i don t find much apart from a few haircuts and the occasional reference to disco that actually evokes the s -- the decade in which i grew up of the episodes i have seen most of the plots and jokes could be set in any time period take away the novelty of supposedly being set in the s and the show is neither interesting nor funny if you re looking for a show that more successfully represents the experience of youth in america in the s in my humble opinion you can do no better than the wonder years 	NEG
why do i constantly do this to myself i mean really it s right there in the title - the incredible melting man what else would i expect i have to admit i m a sucker for just about anything i come across on the monster hd channel but the only redeeming feature of this picture would be that truly grotesque makeup job by the legendary rick baker as for creepy i ll give the nod to that horny old geezer couple sucking on lemons just before lights out now they were truly scary something i could never figure out in horror flicks was why a monster s victims wouldn t simply just run away when faced with virtual annihilation like the chick in the cabin you know there was a door completely visible right there in the kitchen that she could have run right out of at any time incredible steve-o couldn t muster much more than a brisk walk so why not just blow right by him i don t know maybe i m missing something this flick had some of the feel of a tales from the crypt episode but tales usually had a cool or grotesque twist which often times you didn t see coming this was one picture that you couldn t quite get a handle on coming or going for example in an early scene you can clearly make out that melting man s eyeball fell out of his head so how did he manage to get around for the rest of the story i guess we re not supposed to ask at eighty four minutes this picture was about an hour and a half too long when it was all over i was ready to take up general perry on his earlier suggestion - i could really use a drink about now 	NEG
julia roberts obviously makes a concerted effort to shake off her cotton wool pretty woman persona with this spurious spousal abuse thriller but it s hard to imagine she d end up putting in a performance as powerful and convincing and oscar winning as she did in erin brokovich based on the back of this rubbish and make no bones about it it s nothing more than a julia roberts vehicle but unfortunately her performance is not the most lacklustre thing about it the plot has all the markings of a late night made-for-cable and don t be under the impression that it will offer any insight into the dark world of domestic abuse because non of the characters are sketched out enough for you to really care ultimately disappointing and unsatisfying without roberts name above the title i m sure it would have totally flopped deservedly 	NEG
this is the first of these films to die for collection that i ve seen and it s certainly not made me want to see any of the rest although i ve heard at least a couple of them are decent i don t know this wasn t terrible but it didn t really do much for me your basic dysfunctional cannibal family in suburbia kind of thing mom & dad died the family sold the farm & moved to san francisco where they continued to bring home stray food sources whenever possible the best part of this was the creepy goth sister who of course invites a friend over from school that never leaves anyway of course we have a butcher shop in the basement and so on and so on this family is sort of like the white-bread version of the sawyer clan they re nasty & they do bad things but they ain t go no soul i see a lot of reviews from people that liked this and i guess i don t know what i missed but i found it to be very mediocre & i wouldn t recommend it to anyone really out of 	NEG
protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars goldie hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors the story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an arab dignitary the story goes downhill halfway through the movie and goldie s charm just doesn t save this movie unless you are a goldie hawn fan don t go out of your way to see this film 	NEG
i really do not have any clue as to why some people find the power rangers television show even remotely interesting at all the costumes are completely ridiculous and the people playing in them also look completely foolish at the same time there is absolutely anything remotely interesting about the power rangers this is just a higher priced television commercial designed to sell extremely cheesy plastic garbage to the unsuspecting children around the world from the notes i can see that it s been banned in the country of new zealand and from what i have seen i can agree with their decision avoid this show at all costs it s terrible and ridiculous 	NEG
my giving this a score of is not what i would give the original soviet version of this film it seems that american-international a studio that specialized in ultra-low-budget fare in the s bought this film and utterly destroyed it--slicing a two hour plus film into a minute film plus much of this minutes was new material such as the monsters --so you know that this film bears almost no similarity to the original the original film appears to be a rather straight drama about the soviet conquest of space--though i really am not sure what it was originally for insight into the original film read steven nyland s review--it was very helpful by the way this was the third soviet sci-film i ve seen that american-international bought and then hacked apart to make a new film--standard practice to a company that was willing to put just about anything on the screen to make a buck--provided of course it didn t cost them much more than a buck in the first place this americanized film was about two rival world powers not the us and soviets trying to be the first to mars the tricky bad guys try but fail and the good guys rescue one of the idiot astronauts and then head to mars unfortunately they are temporarily stranded on a moon of mars where they see some monsters added by american-international that are reaaaally cheesy and one does bear similarity to a certain part of a female s anatomy then they are rescued--returning to earth heroes the bottom line is that the film was butchered--turning an incredibly beautiful piece of art for the time being turned into a grade-c movie because of this the soviets really had a reason to hate america i m just shocked that the horrible job a-i did with this film didn t convince them to refuse to sell more films to these jerks it s worth a look for a laugh but the really bad moments that make you laugh are few and far between so the film is a dud--not bad enough to make it a must-see for bad movie buffs and too dopey to be taken seriously i would really love to see this movie in its original form--it must have been some picture 	NEG
this is a very odd film i wasn t really sure what is was about some n london lowlifes find a mute kid in the woods that they all believe is some kind of oracle and somehow makes them all in their own way change something about their lives that usually ends in disaster the film ended after about minutes leaving me feeling quite unsatisfied almost annoyed at the pointlessness of it all i didn t care about any of the characters - none of them get a chance to endear themselves to the viewer what was the message am i being dim it was just too odd what happens to runner why does emilio shoot the kid that made absolutely no sense pointless can someone help me understand this mess of a film 	NEG
only children below the age of should be allowed to see this film the rest of us should take a book mp player or just take a nice nap to endure the experience of this event this can be best summed up as a blown-up tv movie being distributed into theaters children will want to see this film and they will like and be amused by the movie 	NEG
as a fan of notorious b i g i was looking forward to this movie i am unfortunate to see it is a terrible movie jamal woodward is not convincing or realistic enough to portray notorious b i g a lot of the story follows notorious b i g s real son christopher jordan wallace as notorious b i g as a kid unfortunately he is not convincing enough to pay tribute to his father derek luke is just as unconvincing as sean puffy combs in a nutshell no one is convincing enough to play their roles here the big problem with this are these are actual people they are playing it was boring and did not give any information about notorious b i g that fans and non-fans alike did not already know i was especially disappointed with angela bassett a very good actress wasted here as voletta wallace the movie slugs and slugs along thinking that notorious b i g fans will spend tons of money on it i am unfortunate to say that that happened it s nowhere close to a good movie i was expecting so much out of it but unfortunately i didn t get anything i wanted from this i think you should definitely skip this one 	NEG
in theory director s commentary should have worked the talented rob bryden plays peter delane a former television director recounting his experiences behind the camera amongst the programmes he is alleged to have worked on are bonanza flambards the duchess of duke street and the bounder his commentaries are not the least bit informative due to his habit of wandering off the point but in practice it failed dismally it is a one-joke show and the joke is not particularly funny the scripts are completely lacking in wit and bryden fails to convince as an old man whenever stuck for anything amusing to say which is like every five seconds he issues a hissing laugh rather than being amused by delane you want to shoot him if senile old men strike you as hilarious then this is for you it didn t help that the shows mocked were with the exceptions of mr & mrs and crossroads rather good for the joke to work they needed to be really dreadful such as charlie s angels o t t telly addicts neighbours and new faces the show tanked big time so thankfully we are spared the horror of future editions wouldn t it be deliciously ironic if director s commentary were someday itself the subject of a spoof 	NEG
there is a reason why jay leno himself will not acknowledge this film it consistently ranks as one of the worst films of all time the acting is horrible the script lacks direction and the director himself doesn t seem sure on which way to take this film a buddy film an action comedy mystery seems half way through he gives up and is just along for the ride jay leno and pat morita are talented and dedicated performers it is a shame that they wasted their time and gifts making this mess of a movie jay leno and pat morita prior to involving themselves with this had spent years pounding out their crafts on the hollywood circuit mr morita had already been a star in his own right acting steadily since the mid s as the star of such cult tv and movie classics as happy days and the dismal but affable mr t and tina and won the hearts of america with his roles in the powerful film midway the karate kid and a host of others mr leno can been seen on tv shows dating back to the mid s and was a top performer in the comedy clubs of america he can be seen in countless tv spots and in major films it is a shame that they agreed to be seen with this nonsense 	NEG
who was george c scott george c scott was a renowned actor practically any movie that he s been in is the better off for it now ol george had absolutely nothing to do with this movie but he once said something that describes said movie to a t i don t recall his exact words but he basically said that great writing can save bad acting but great acting cannot save bad writing never has this little observation been truer than in the all new adventures of laurel & hardy: for love or mummy the casting of the two leads was absolutely perfect bronson pinchot laurel and gailard sartain hardy not only look the parts but they do an exceptionally good job at mimicking the real deal mannerisms and all this movie should stand as a lasting testament to their talents that said this movie falls flat on its face when it comes to you guessed it writing aside from the opening dialogue between pinchot and sartain which was very in character and a brief gag involving a taxi this movie is an absolute chore to sit through problem # : too much time and effort went into the plot i don t want to know why the mummy wants to kidnap the pretty british lady what i want is to see stan and ollie or at least their stand-ins way too much screen time was devoted to explaining the plot or to the not-very-funny secondary characters that said plot revolved around however even if this movie had been all jokes that would still leave us with problem # : most of the jokes are what i would call watered-down slapstick what do i mean by watered down in slapstick a character gets hurt in an exaggerated way for comedic effect ala looney tunes stooges or how about laurel & hardy in watered-down slapstick as i define it a character gets mildly hurt or inconvenienced and the filmmakers play that up for comedic effect maybe an illustration would help:in looney tunes daffy duck gets shot by elmer fudd his bill falls off and he puts it back on that is classic slapstick in this gem ollie accidentally bumps into some people they turn around tell him to be careful and continue on their merry way that s not slapstick that s not even funny that s just boring and this movie is full of these kinds of jokes it s as though they re this movie s bread and butter the writers and directors just take these dull moments and act like they re supposed to be funny granted the example i just gave is the most extreme case but i can only cut it so much slack long story short: the film just doesn t work because the script fails to capitalize on pinchot s and sartain s abilities to impersonate stan and ollie instead the script capitalizes on plot exposition and lame jokes watching this movie is basically watching two excellent impersonators who were given no real material to work with not a good movie but an incredible sleeping aid i say give this one a miss and stick with the real deal just so long as you steer clear of atoll k and be big 	NEG
the horror channel plays nothing but erotic soft porn gothic flicks each night from pm till about in the morning but their scare factor is very limited if one exists at all in fact i am sure i will find a multi-million pound lottery win more scary than anything this channel has to offer the bloodsucker leads the dance deserves special mention because it is i feel the undisputed low of a channel full of lows i cannot even begin to tell you how bad this film is but for the purpose of completing the minimum lines demanded by this site i will at least give it a go firstly the title is misleading and bears no resemblance to the action on the screen in fact the film might as well have been called toothbrush or wallpaper for all it has to do with the plot at least they used toothbrushes at least they had wallpaper there are no bloodsuckers for miles around and whats even worse there are no dances not one i m sure they were making two different films by mistake here a more suitable title would have been horny italian count leads five people to a scary castle and bores us silly for ninety minutes yes that fits better the acting is terrible and and the dubbing appalling and that guy who plays seymour was almost as wooden in his walk as he was in his character abysmal the only saving graces of this film are a small but slightly interesting lesbian sex scene two small and very interesting heterosexual sex scenes and the added attraction in that every single female character gets her kit off bonus otherwise steer a wide birth away from this one no vampires no dancing no scenes of a brutal or gruesome nature and no way on gods earth i will ever ever ever watch this one again no word of a lie this film could put you off motion pictures for life 	NEG

as a spiritualist and non christian i thought i really was going to be holding onto my faith but what a load of i seers i thought the film would have great arguments but only got one sided views from atheists and jews and who are all these street people he s interviewing who don t know the back of their arm from their head where are the proper theologians and priests and stuff he could have got arguments from not retired nuts who wrote books and finished their studies in personally this dvd was a waste of time and not worth my time to check if the facts are right or wrong or if i should or should not believe because an anti-christ told me so please to think he came up with the conclusion of not finding god because his own ego and demons got the better of him no im not going to say the movie was stunning to help atheists reading this feel better about themselves but if you really want to show the world you care about us poor souls who believe in jesus then entice us with your worth not your beating off the drums 	NEG
i agree with other users comments in that the two main roles were well acted that being the guy that played gary gillmore and giovanni s role too bad the story was so boring not hearing about the story i knew nothing of gary gillmore before the movie so i didn t know what to expect i thought it would be something like dead man walking or the chamber but how wrong i was the whole movie was just talking talking and talking about their mom and dad the only cool scenes were the flashbacks where the dad would lose his temper that was the only interest i got from this borefest 	NEG
i think that movie can`t be a scott`s film that is impossible do you remember blade runner and alien two greats movies versus a one i hope didn´t see ever it good bye 	NEG
it s a while ago that i have seen sleuth with two great actors michael caine and laurence olivier michael caine is back but he is now the husband and jude law the lover of his wife the story is still the same and it s a fantastic play during the movie i always had the feeling to watch a play that s one of the reasons i dislike this remake of a classic when i watch a movie adapted a play i still must feel to see a movie and not just a play director kenneth brannigan did some marvelous movies in the past but this time he missed another reason was the look of the movie the design was modern stylish clean uncomfortable and cold i never got the feeling that somebody ever lived in that house the photography wasn t bad but the lightening was awful sometimes there was blue light dark green light to round it up not friendly for eyes the acting was really good michael caine s and jude law s perform at their best i really would like to see these guys playing together on stage but i have to confess i never was a fan of jude law the weakest part was the mid part i remember that in the original that this part was still very mysterious and just marvelous directed i tried to watch it twice and always in the mid part i felt asleep the end part is better and more interesting sleuth isn t awful but it seems to be more a movie for critics than for the audience sleuth is still a masterpiece and much more entertaining than sleuth 	NEG
harsh yes but i call em like i see em i saw this in the late s and it was truly one of the most awful boring films i ve ever forced myself to watch yes the cinematography is lovely the czech settings are truly stunning the political backdrop is enticing but unlike similar historically set stories e g _dr zhivago_ qv this one failed to make the politics relevant to the story or even interesting sure olin and binoche are beautiful but this film manages to make even erotic scenes plodding and slow i m all for romance but this movie was so boring i started hoping the russians would shoot them all and put an end to my misery i m sure if i d read the book the story would have made a bit more sense however life s too short to expend any more time on this one 	NEG
the good:effective color scheme good costumes top notch set production well detailed cgi buildings and vehicles the bad:horrible mixture of actors with all cgi actors mixes fifth element with final fantasy the cgi actors look even worse than video games from a few years ago flawed logic a giant pyramid shows up and no one researches it no one really even questions it and there is no explanation as to why the god horus was even cast out nor was there any reason why he must do something as trivial as impregnate jill the ugly:awful script so many unnecessary subplots with too many ideas that are not fully realized the dialog was almost laughable at some points random characters and events that are not needed dull characters jill is supposed to be this mystery but apparently she was just a mystery to the writer there is nothing to her she is uninteresting and boring to watch she has no substance no texture her character has no redeeming qualities in fact there is not one character in the entire film who has any purpose any goals besides the obvious one of horus any motivation they are weak and ill-conceived there are no stakes - the key to screen writing horus will not become immortal but big deal he is a bad guy one cannot even decipher whether horus or jill is the main character that is the problem: devoting half the movie to each character means the writer never fully explores one character never brings one to fruition they are cardboard cut-outs who walk around and talk and pretty much do nothing but explore the fine set pieces first time director pacing slow slow slow i am still watching the movie as i write this i cannot pay attention because it is boring everything is flat even the action is not interesting because it is short-lived and sometimes unnecessary overall:not worth a watch threadbare story sub-par character development corny cgi does not save the nice set production 	NEG
after watching this film i was left with a two very annoyances about this film: why did they make chen s character this mcguyver hit-man and lee s character such an incompetent idiot chen s character s background is that he was raised in an underground cambodian orphanage for blood thirsty fighter where they learn to brawl it out to the death like wild dogs this detail is pushed early on during a scene where he gets into a cab and as it starts to drive he shows how he is unfamiliar with a seat belt soon after this scene he has a similar situation at a dim sum restaurant not only is he uneducated he is starving this is not a reference to chen s scrawny physique but to the two early scenes in the film where he is scarfing down food one of which being rice porridge off the floor of the lower deck on an old ship si in the first ten minutes of the film it is established that chen is malnutrition-ed unmodernized and has only thing going for him his dog brawling fighting style of some sort despite this situation chen manages to out-shoot every policeman even managing to ricochet a bullet off a metal pipe to hit a guy in a head whom was holding chen s girlfriend hostage and has somehow attained a super human strength swings a lb block of concrete plastered on the end of a metal pipe to the head of the police chief as he is getting shot in the chest by said chief now lee s character okay i get it he s depressed he s got some baggage but wow can he do anything right one moment they try to make him cool composed and ready to take care of business and the next moment he just got beat again first scene he runs into chen and he manages to misses him from approx ft multiple times toward the end of that scene lee watches chen as his close friend and coworker gets slowly stabbed in the neck with a long knife for a good full seconds while holding a gun to chen face at a ft distance even at the end of the movie lee manages to get stabbed to death and fails once again and my biggest problem with this movie is that it is presented in a manner that film makers are trying to get the audience to sympathize with chen s character and that he is just killing to survive that would be a lot easier if i didn t just watch chen kill innocent people throughout the whole awful movie of the numerous people he killed only two people had the intention of trying to kill him the police chief and lee others were just people who were eating boat owners taxi drivers and policemen trying to arrest him not kill overall chen s character is a just a cold blooded killer who kills for what he wants even if its just a free ride did i mention he is carrying a wad of hundred dollar bills throughout most of the film my stars go to some of the interesting director camera work who got in some nice shots bottomline: one made for the nut-hugging chen fans for me dog bite this dvd 	NEG
i didn t know this was a silent movie with narration i don t care for silent movies - the corny humor flickering lighting and film etc i m sure that attributes to the low score i assigned it it was about chapter before i found any interest in this story and had i had popcorn i may have thrown it at the screen maybe this appeals to the sci-fi crowd the only thing missing was a zombie scene and a brain transplant i went with two other people on a friday night and there were a total of people in the entire theater isabella rosselinni narrated this movie - the one enjoyable aspect of the movie no one left commenting how much they enjoyed this nor appreciated the unusual approach to telling this story i cannot recommend this movie 	NEG
there s nothing new for me to say: hours of people dying over and over in the same hill the cast was stellar but unfortunately the producer director editor god goofed he should have eaten humble pie if not for his own sake then for the men who died in kargil hired one of these brilliant bollywood directors hired a real scriptwriter hired a real editor hired a musician that wasn t related to him in some way and who seemed to have listened to some bad version of apocalypse now on some cheap indian drug hired a real professional crew thrown away all the fireworks and told a real story unfortunately he like the bigwigs of the indian army made decisions that were terrible for his actors and terrible for his audience we all died over and over please don t do that again sir sushma kathmandu nepalps: next time an indian director decides to glorify the gurkha regiment i suggest he hire more than one nepali to represent the team surely there are plenty of nepali men working in bombay--last count was to half a million 	NEG
a lot of themes or parts of the story is the same as in leon then other parts felt like some other movie i don t know which but there are an familiar feeling over the whole movie it was kind of nice to watch but it would have been fantastic if the story would have been more original the theme little girl bad assassin from leon is just tweaked a little the opening scenes are really good :- it is strange that people like to fight in the kitchen in the movies :- my biggest problem was to remember which parts was from leon nikita and if they where from the french or american version if you have not seen leon then this is a good movie if you liked this movie then i can recommend leon best regards rick	NEG
why were there so many people crowding into an evening showing of roberto moreira s up against them all contra todos at the san francisco film festival it s about a hit man my friend said well and it s brazilian i added beautiful multicolored people tropical weather lush rhythms and a hip gangster plot ample enticements no doubt somebody forgot to tell us one little detail: this is a very bad movie really pretty horrible and as unpleasant to watch as it is poorly made so how on earth did contra todos get to make the rounds of berlin melbourne london manila stockholm cairo chicago numerous smaller local festivals and now san francisco apparently because of the way the promotional process and the film festival circuit work first of all it won first prize at the rio film festival where it was called the best brazilian movie of the year it must have been a bad year; they ve had much much better ones next snappy synopses in catalogs plus imaginary buzz lead to crowded auditoriums and -- since the movie isn t featured anywhere and so avoids close scrutiny by critics -- it keeps going the rounds festival blurbs aimed at promotion sometimes goose it up a lot a chicago festival one called contra todos a speedball cocktail shot straight out of brazil and referred to claudia s s boyfriend as the stud of the slum-like neighborhood soninha is teodoro s nymph-like teen-aged daughter of burgeoning sexuality the movie is shot with the urgency of a frequently hand-held camera and the director works up a genuine and palpable sense of frustration borne from domestic desperation and decay the effect is unbearably raw and honest and the movie hurtles toward a conclusion as dead-ended as the lives on display not the best writing but it sure pumps up the excitement for a certain kind of potential viewer contra todos does concern a hit man two hit men actually and a wife and daughter and a born-again christian girlfriend it s shot -- in execrably ugly digital video with no talent behind the camera-work -- mostly in a barren-looking poor suburb rather than in one of the teeming favelas or village-like brazilian city slums where such wonderful films as black orpheus pixote and city of god were made and not in rio this time but são paulo the hit man with family problems is teodoro giulio lopez and his partner with a drug problem is waldomiro ailtan graça both actors have a little tv experience as does the actress who plays teodoro s sluttish blonde wife cláudia leona cavalli and silvia lorenço who plays his pouting ready-to-revolt daughter soninha these actors might make it through the back corners of a few telenovelas who knows -- in a better directed film they might even be good aside from them there are some young men who get bumped off by teordoro or when he s busy gangs of thugs the principals don t work up much presence even though the camera magnifies their pores a couple of observers one at the berlin festival and one at london s did see this movie s failings but alas they re buried in the web hinterlands henry sheehan noted from berlin that the film his quotes was the worst of the video works shown the filmmaker seems to have chosen video simply because it was a cheap alternative to film sheehan wrote and hasn t made any creative use of the new medium -- nor he adds done anything else creative sheehan pointed out the movie s first big mistake: it starts off as a domestic drama that s supposed to ratchet up when half an hour into the action moreira reveals that the father and one of his friends are professional hit men waiting the thirty minutes adds nothing to the movie; it seems like a perfectly arbitrary decision and is at the very least a waste of time but ratcheting up is all moreira ever does like a little kid who s gotten a tool kit for his birthday and goes around banging everything in sight without rhyme reason or skill devastating but true writing about the london festival for kamera com metin alsanjak tried to look at the positive side but nonetheless gave away the lack of redeeming features in calling the performances easily the film s best feature yes very easily given that everything else is so bad alsanjak admitted that this low-budget violent and seedy account of the lawless in sao paulo is devoid of any likable characters and as a result of hope too dark and cynical to be a telling account of the human condition the film is not helped by poor subtitling alsanjak s connecting contra todos to dogme and mike leigh didn t help matters apart from that meaningless first half hour in which nothing redeems the boredom of our wait for the first acts of violence -- which when they come are just banging everything in sight without rhyme reason or skill -- moreira clumsily tries to redeem his abrupt finale by adding what appear to be outtakes right after it followed by an implausible ironic concluding scene where one of the characters gets married no doubt the director wanted to exhibit the banality of evil of low-level hit men in working class neighborhoods but he can t make the characters which he sees generically come alive for us and the structure of the film shows that he also can t edit his material seen at the san francisco international film festival on april 	NEG
really really bad slasher movie a psychotic person escapes from an asylum three years later he kills a sociology professor end of scene one semester yesterday later hey that s what the title card said a new sociology professor is at the school she makes friends with another female sociology professor who works there and starts dating another professor the students are all bored as are we there are a number of title cards indicating how much time has passed scenes are pretty short and cut to different characters somewhere else making for little progression of any kind a lot of scenes involve characters walking and talking or sitting and talking and serve little purpose despite the passage of time many of the characters are always wearing the same clothing sometimes the unclear passage of time means when we see a body for the second time we ask ourselves: how long has that body been there and also at least one of the dead people don t seem to have been missed by others the killer manages to kill one person by stabbing her in the breast another by stabbing him in the crotch and another by slicing her forehead is his knife poisoned or something the video box cover has a cheerleader: there aren t any in the movie the rear cover has a photo of someone in a graduation cap and gown menacing a group of women in a dorm room the central redhead in the photo is in the movie but nobody ever wears such an outfit and there is no such scene the killer is strictly one-on-one 	NEG
i m not a fan of the left behind book series - the books are written at a th-grade reading level with a lack of research and understanding of science technology and politics while the books do manage to remain faithful to scripture their methods of fulfilling prophecy are often ridiculous an example is their explanation for the russian arab invasion of israel also the books have an unmistakable preachy tone that will turn off unbelievers rather than bring them to the gospel still i found myself reading these books because of my interest in the events of revelation for a similar reason i watched this film adaptation i am sad to say that it is a rather mediocre film bordering on poor the acting is actually rather decent for the most part with occasional bits of poor acting and over-acting the script is rather bad though it is hardly unexpected when starting with the novel as a basis the characters are poorly drawn and underdeveloped events feel scattered and disconnected the dialogue sometimes sounds rushed at least the book managed to flesh out its hokey conspiracy theory here the viewer is left with an incoherent mess that only makes much sense if one has read the book the pacing of the film is also very poorly executed with the opening and conclusion seeming extremely rushed and the middle dragging to an excruciatingly slow trudge that makes it feel padded the music is schizophrenic at times it successfully underscores the mood and sounds fitting for a motion picture at other moments it reminds me of sitcom and mini-series music and still other bits remind me of a poppy mtv soundtrack that just doesn t belong in the film i can give the film points for the scene of panic on board the plane but that s it the other scenes involving the disasters after the rapture are far from compelling the film also suffers from the book s preachiness although its message isn t quite as in your face in all i found the movie just as disappointing as the series this is not the film to rally christians around it i hope that this film does not get any attention at the theaters next year it would be more unnecessary bad publicity for christianity for an example of a compelling intelligent well-researched series based on revelation that presents a realistic and christian world view without offending the secular reader who after all should be whom a christian is trying to reach read the christ clone trilogy by james beauseigneur it s a great read and is a much better choice for unbelievers or believers who appreciate quality 	NEG
watching this film for the action is rather a waste of time because the figureheads on the ships act better than the humans it s a mercy that anthony quinn couldn t persuade anyone else to let him direct any other films after this turkey but it is filled with amusement value since yul brynner has hair lorne greene displays an unconvincing french accent and the rest of the big names strut about in comic-book fashion 	NEG
follow-up to s walking tall continues the real-life drama surrounding tennessee sheriff buford pusser but this installment plays like a lame tv-movie bo svenson takes over the lead role from joe don baker but he s much too mild for the part; he comes off like an ambling country singer with a bat instead of a guitar good supporting actors like richard jaekel luke askew and robert doqui end up with very little to do i would give the film one-star strictly on its good intentions but the screenplay is a transparent and lazy mass of routine predicaments and the production is cheapjack followed in by final chapter-walking tall and in by the television film a real american hero 	NEG
yes the southern star features a pretty forgettable title tune sung by that heavy set crooner matt monro it pretty much establishes the tone for this bloated and rather dull feature stunningly miscast with george segal and ursula andress as an adventurous couple in search of a large diamond add in harry andrews with a strange accent no less chasing an ostrich tons of stock footage of wildlife and poorly composed and dull photography by raoul coutard and you end up with a thoroughly unexciting romp through the jungles of senegal 	NEG
down to earth out of four by blake french: down to earth is such a mislead and desperate comedy it makes sitting home on the couch watching a chris rock standup-comedy act on tv look like heaven speaking of heaven the film is based on the movie heaven can wait that was a good movie and this is good-to demonstrate how a group of aspiring screenwriters can take decent material and turn it into garbage directors chris and paul weitz miss nearly every target from concept to storytelling down to earth fails miserably; this is one incredibly bad production chris rock is a lousy standup comedian both in his role in this movie and in the real life he plays lance barton whose manager frankie faison even feels sorry for him when he is booed off stage during amateur night at a local theatre soon after the script establishes his lack of talent the character is killed by a speeding truck death played by eugene levy has made a mistake taking lance before his number was up god s assistant chazz palminteri is very angry and decides to let lance make up the remainder of his time on earth as long as he takes the only available body of a year old white millionaire the old man s name is mr wellington whose life has problems of its own his wife jennifer coolidge is having an affair with his assistant greg germann who is robbing him of his money but that s all right because lance inside mr wellington has fallen in love with a young black woman named sontee regina king meanwhile there are plots to kill wellington lance attempting to get a better body and sontee s confused feelings dealing with a hospital situation involving mr wellington s finances down to earth has some good ideas but they are in a pointless and unconvincing love story filled with contrivances and recycled material the biggest problem it runs into is how we perceive lance as mr wellington chris rock is the actor with popularity and publicity so he is not going to be absent from most of this movie; all of the characters see the new lance as mr wellington but we see him as chris rock this is convenient for the love story; we believe a young woman would fall for lance but in reality he is actually an old gray-haired geezer that is not so convincing the one-joke comic situation is supposed to be watching an old man doing funny things that are really done by a young black man but what inspires laughter is when characters run into conflicts without their knowledge just look at there s something about mary in the funny scenes the characters are exposed to awkward experiences and not at their will here lance knows he is in an old man s body and does things old men would not normally do if lance did not know the body he was in then that may have had potential another problem with the concept: we never knew mr wellington in the first place so how can we compare lance in his body when we do not know what he was like originally to top everything off chris rock needs to be the center of attention here and makes the character too much like rock he recites simple standup routine jokes that are tedious and painful; his dialogue is so obvious wooden and straightforward i hated the film s sense of humor there are so many unfunny jokes and horrible comic situations it is like watching chris rock being chris rock not a character in a movie let s emphasize the positives in down to earth mark addy does not do any worse here than he did in the flintstones in viva rock vegas eugene levy and chazz palmentari are well cast but they are at the mercy of a scalped script those are all the good qualities i can mention at this time and if you give me another week to recollect it is not likely that i will come up with any more 	NEG
the premise of an african-american female scrooge in the modern struggling city was inspired but nothing else in this film is here ms scrooge is a miserly banker who takes advantage of the employees and customers in the largely poor and black neighborhood it inhabits there is no doubt about the good intentions of the people involved part of the problem is that story s roots don t translate well into the urban setting of this film and the script fails to make the update work also the constant message about sharing and giving is repeated so endlessly the audience becomes tired of it well before the movie reaches its familiar end this is a message film that doesn t know when to quit in the title role the talented cicely tyson gives an overly uptight performance and at times lines are difficult to understand the charles dickens novel has been adapted so many times it s a struggle to adapt it in a way that makes it fresh and relevant in spite of its very relevant message 	NEG

imagine that you are asked by your date what movie you wanted to see and you remember seeing a rather intriguing trailer about the grudge so in good faith you recommend seeing that movie it is the halloween season after all and it did boffo box office this past weekend so it must be pretty good so you go and you re actually in a state of shock when the movie ends the way it does and you hear yourself audibly saying that can t be the end of the movie but alas it is and imagine coming out of the movie theater being embarrassed and ashamed for recommending such a dog of a movie you think that your date thinks you re a bonehead for suggesting such an atrocity and your suggestion will certainly end a promising relationship actually it was so bad that both of us cracked up laughing at how bad it was i see no future for miss gellar in the movies and suggest that she sticks to television in the future actually it won t be long before she is consigned to flea-market conventions selling buffy memorabilia and it can t happen soon enough if you ask me horrible horrible horrible the plot didn t make sense; continuity was terrible it s apparent that the whole ending was contrived to have a grudge ii--the return of cat-boy 	NEG
one of scorsese s worst an average thriller; the only thing to recommend it is de niro playing the psycho the finale is typically of this genre i e over-the-top with yet another almost invincible immune-to-pain villain i didn t like the s original and this version wasn t much of an improvement on it i have no idea why scorsese wasted his time on a remake then again considering how bad his recent movies have been i m referring to his dull buddhist movie and all the ones with his new favourite actress the blond girl di caprio this isn t even that bad by comparison and considering spielberg wanted to do the remake could have been far worse 	NEG

my original review of this film was simply the word sh t written times over although this was a very accurate critique i felt my review should be a little more descriptive i will start with the lead actress; her facial expression doesn t change once in this film she doesn t show fear happiness or depression her skills in body language pretty much come down to darting her eyes left and right and looking like she don t know jack she is an emotionless husk who i m guessing has had too much botox her lack of facial expression through out the film is outmatched however by the deplorable love affair with the lead actor which seems to spring out of nowhere and has them making out on a beach and falling in love within a couple of hours of meeting one another the lead actor whose hair demands more attention than he did was mediocre at best and did not once make me feel like he was genuinely in peril the only thing that tops the hideous acting is the directing storyline and inaccuracies in plot i have seen tampon ads with more structure than this movie the is no development in character they just seem to say and do things that i could never believe a real person would this film would not have been bad if it was trying to be crap on purpose like snakes on a plane but it was trying so hard to be a serious action flick that i couldn t even laugh i believe i now have a brain tumour from watching this film and thinking up all the different ways i could have used that budget and cg team to create something far superior if i bought this on dvd i would smash the dvd to pieces burn it then dissolve it in hydrochloric acid for good measure don t watch this film 	NEG
this movie should have never been made what a shame of the budget please hire convincing actors and make a proper movie very thin plot and unconvincing lines almost hilarious and that is a shame for an action movie definitely not worth watching they keep replaying the same shots of an stealth airplane flying away you have seen it ones and that was not worth re-running or times it is time for steven seagal to retire from movie-making his movies are getting worser every time black dawn and submerged were already bad but this movie is even worse 	NEG
hood of the living dead and all of the other movies these guys directed look like they got together and filmed this with their buddies who have zero talent one afternoon when they were bored lines are completely unrehearsed and unconvincing i find that % of amateur movies and % of home video footage is better than this film although the similarities between them warrant the comparison hey lets see if anyone is dumb enough to buy our movies hopefully nobody else wasn t my apologies to those involved in the flic as this review is somewhat harsh but i was the dope who read your fake reviews and purchased the movie 	NEG
at the beginning of the film you might double-check the dvd cover and re-read the synopsis a couple of times but no worries it s not memoirs of a geisha that you purchased; just a movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it has any right to be still the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie as it shows how in the year a samurai sword master catches his wife committing adultery he decapitates the two lovers before doing some hara-kiri ritual suicide through disembowelment cut to present day when the american ambassador in japan welcomes a befriended family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago from then onwards this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional let s start with the good aspects namely the original japanese setting and the presence of the delicious susan george who is my all-time favorite british horror wench well together with britt eckland linda hayden and ingrid pitt the bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only evoke laughter the restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenants and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff the spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into susan s ravishing booty and transforming her into a lewd seductress in this possessed state she even lures the american ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guests so strictly spoken it s not really evil that dwells in the house; just a trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their long-dead hands obviously these scenes are more comical than frightening especially since the light-blue and transparent shapes remind you of the cute ghost effects that were later popularized in ghostbusters the house where evil dwells is probably the least scary ghost movie ever throughout most of the running time you ll be wondering whether director kevin connor who nevertheless made the excellent horror films motel hell and from beyond the grave intentionally wanted to make his movie funny and over-the-top like motel hell maybe but then again everyone in the cast continues to speak his her lines with a straight and sincere face so i guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed the house where evil dwells is never suspenseful or even remotely exciting and it doesn t even contain any grisly images apart from the massacre at the beginning i am fully aware of how shallow it sounds but the two scenes in which susan george goes topless are the only true highlights well those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously over-sized spiders or are they crabs in the daughter s bedroom how totally random and irrelevant was that if you ever decide to give this movie a chance notwithstanding its bad reputation make sure you leave your common sense and reasoning at the doorstep trivia note for horror buffs: keep an eye open for the demon-mask that was also a pivot piece of scenery in the brilliant japanese horror classic onibaba 	NEG
i just saw this movie premiere on mtv i must say this was extremely mediocre at its best the dialogue doesn t explain the story very well and i was left feeling like there were a lot of plot holes there isn t one likable character in this adaptation due to poor acting i just find that all of the characters are way too possessive when it comes to someone they love also cate and heath s love seems very incestuous they seem more like brother and sister rather than lovers i don t understand why the father would accept something like that under his roof i watched this movie because of a few actors that i respected and enjoyed to watch in previous films but like i said it s extremely hard to like any of the characters katherine heigl s performance was horrid which was a complete shocker she was terrible at being the bitchy older sister of edward and there just wasn t enough lines for aimee osbourne for me even to critique her performance johnny whitworth did well and it was great seeing him in something recent and even though his character was a bit kooky he was the only person i sympathized with as for erika christensen and mike vogel they were supposed to be our heroines but came off as whiny and overdramatic i just didn t enjoy this movie very much or the music in it there was a brief appearance of the christian punk band mxpx but that small appearance would not convince me to watch this movie again mtv did a tremendous job in convincing me this was a movie it was not i just pictured something so completely different 	NEG
story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy a formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane violent mob by the crazy chantings of it s singers unfortunately it stays absurd the whole time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting even those from the era should be turned off the cryptic dialogue would make shakespeare seem easy to a third grader on a technical level it s better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great vilmos zsigmond future stars sally kirkland and frederic forrest can be seen briefly 	NEG
if it wasn t for some immature gullible idiot i know insisting that i watch this documentary i would never have seen this comedy this film is full of bad scripting and laughable moments one in particular is where the afghan police soldiers arrest don larson for filming in the streets while they allow the cameraman to carry on filming his arrest and then drive away still filming presumably to his plush hotel then there s the scene where a car crashes into another car which has been turned upside down and parked nicely on the side of the road without any evidence of it being in a crash or explosion i am surprised this has currently got the rating it has i thought imdb users had more sense 	NEG
the only real highlight in the movie is the death of the sniveling guy and the reaction of the surviving characters to it in every other way this film is a very lame rip-off of jaws lake placid and alligator with a little bit of godzilla thrown in as is standard for a s-style horror movie the two non-starring females each take their clothes off at least once the female lead doesn t since she obviously has a better agent the whole movie surrounds the filming of a really dumb extreme sport called blood surfing in which surfers cut themselves and surf in shark-infested waters in this film a giant salt-water crocodile also happens to be in the area people get eaten the movie ends i don t mind a bad horror movie but i really hate a dull bad horror movie which this definitely is 	NEG
i went to see this one with much expectation quite unfortunately the dialogue is utterly stupid and overall the movie is far from inspiring awe or interest even a child can see the missing logic to character s behaviors today s kids need creative stories which would inspire them which would make them daydream about the events that s precisely what happened with movies like e t and star wars a decade ago how many kids imagined about becoming jedi knights and igniting their own lightsabers seriously don t waste your time & money on this one 	NEG

everybody knows that gregory widen s original the prophecy didn t really require a sequel but you also don t need a degree in rocket science hanging above your chimney to realize that further cash-ins on this profitable horror concept were inevitable part two is a very prototypic example of a straight-to-video sequel meaning the creative and convoluted plot of the original has been simplified a lot in favor of more action more witty one-liners and a lot more eerie religious scenery the only good news is that the producers managed to keep christopher walken for the role of gabriel and he delivers another gloriously brazen performance that promptly justifies the price of a rental if it wasn t for walken s performance and perhaps a couple of players in the supportive cast like brittany murphy and glenn danzig the prophecy ii surely would have disappeared into oblivion straight after its release the movie begins with gabriel literally getting spat out of hell to proceed with his ongoing war of heaven here on earth the purpose of his battle this time is to prevent the baby of nurse valerie rosales jennifer beals from getting born for you see her unborn child is the first ever hybrid between a heavenly angel and an earthly monkey and the birth of such a superior being would imply the downfall of gabriel s evil dominion thus just as in the first movie he engages a suicidal accomplice to assist him and hunts valerie all the way down to the eden for the final showdown the prophecy ii is an endurable and occasionally even entertaining movie as long as you don t make comparisons with the original and as long as you manage to overlook the multiple plot holes and errors in continuity whenever the storyline becomes too tedious the makers luckily enough always insert a near-brilliant christopher walken moment to distract you his interactions with the rebellious izzy and particularly his ignorance regarding modern earthly technologies often result in worthwhile and memorable sequences on a slightly off-topic note i often felt like the prophecy ii ambitions to look similar to terminator ii  gabriel s resurrection looked somewhat like the teleportation of a futuristic cyborg and the eden location where the final battle takes place looks very similar to the steel factory where terminator ii ended as well coincidence i guess overall this is an inferior and passable sequel but still worth checking out in case you re a fan of christopher walken s unique acting charisma and who isn t 	NEG
the next time you are at a party and someone asks the other day i heard the expression author s will does anyone know what it means tell them to sit through head above water the only way diaz could possibly have survived this movie was by means of this literary device commonly used by bad writers there are some comic scenes and you will have a few laughs however the film does not stand up to the most minor logical analysis why does keitel tie diaz s hand in front of her instead of behind why so she can do the chainsaw gag of course for me the best part of this movie was that i saw it on a cable channel instead of spending four bucks at the video shop 	NEG
this film is so incredibly bad that i almost felt sick watching it up until this point the other installments had at least one good thing about it part was suspenseful and gory part was off beat and entertaining part was interesting with great effects part had great music good special effects and a new entertaining freddy krueger part is more boring than anything i ve ever seen before alice a much prettier blond from part is back with her boyfriend dan at parts this supposed elm street installment turns into a daytime soap the newer characters seem harsh and even that sweet alice has a chip on her shoulder freddy seems to be completely out of this one he looks tired and doesn t seem to be as gruesome his one-liners seem out of place and different where as in part they could be pretty funny leslie bohem s story never gets off the ground and stephen hopkins direction is so bad that it makes my grandmother look good the whole plot of this movie is ridiculous and unrealistic it s also confusing and pretty stupid avoid part at all costs 	NEG
the film my name is modesty is based around an episode that takes up about one page in the th modesty blaise novel called night of the morningstar it describes an incident in which the young modesty in the book mid twenties in the film asserts her leadership in a war over a casino as this is set before the actual blaise adventures her trusted sidekick willi garvin is not in the film that is one of the main problems as the relationship between blaise and garvin was certainly always one of the fascinating aspects of the novels and the long running comic strip the other problem is that the film is quite simply incredibly boring because it really is just one small episode blown up into a screenplay the casting is okay but alexandra staden is not really convincing as the heroine and actually too old for the role to play the young modesty i get the impression that this film was a quick and dirty solution as not to lose the rights to the blaise franchise 	NEG

i never quite understood the popularity of saban s power rangers show which was quite simply a second rate americanized version of japan s ultra popular super sentai series of the past three decades what was cool about the japanese version gets completely lost in the american version characterization special effects etc of course many kids will say that power rangers are the greatest but they would be incorrect i m sure if they spoke japanese they would learn how much better super sentai is over the american version power rangers is completely awful try super sentai instead looking for a better show try voltron the third dimension instead 	NEG
if you haven t figured out what is going to happen in this film in the first five minutes then give it a couple more minutes lilia is a widow she has been left on the shelf for too long and she wants to burst out she has a teenage daughter which only highlights that she is not getting any younger while checking up on her daughter she discovers a world she never dared the cabaret where she can belly dance in skimpy sequined outfits while men throw money at her the film is very misogamist it s portrayal of men is dismal which is rather odd as lilia stoops to jiggle around for them not for money but just for the hell of it when she succeeds in arousing them it makes her feel like a woman again she does not wish to connect with them but she is addicted to the attention the other dancers all are mostly aging women who look like men in drag and realize their time in the spotlight is short-lived not short enough i say she does find romance however brief with you guessed it no surprises here we didn t see coming though the ending is good you realize that it could have ended no other way maybe this film just isn t targeting my demographic- male	NEG
this movie masquerades as a social commentary when in fact it is every bit as ridiculous as the very racism it condemns the premise of this movie: african-american = strong any other race = weak the worst part is when rapaport pulls a gun on omar epps and a jewish guy the jewish guy in stereotypical fashion crumbles in fear and starts pleading for his life but the big strong defiant omar epps stands strong with no fear we also have the condemnation of every fraternity member as being a arrogant preppie drunk or rapist the raped white girl of course begins considering lesbianism since she s just a weak white girl after all when the nerdy white guy is rejected by the fraternity members he of course must fall in with the skinheads who are incredible cowards; especially the big muscular guy who is beaten down quickly by the strong black men wait busta rhymes beat up a guy twice his size yeah right of course the black men never reject their own people and omar epps moves in with them easily the scenes where ice cube threatens his white roommates and keeps them in line are just stupid -- of course he is the dominating one while his weak white roommates sit in fear of him and eventually move out this movie was just terrible and the ending made me actually laugh out loud the overly long slow-motion between epps and banks gets hilarious with the faces they make -- it s like watching my nephew and cousins making faces at each other and they re all under do yourself a favor and skip this crapfest 	NEG
we ve all been there sitting with some friends watching a bad movie laughing at how terribly it was made and how poor the acting was; eventually the credits roll and everyone looks around and says how is it possible such a movie was made who paid money to have this script made into a feature film well jigsaw is not that kind of film instead of asking how this garbage was budgeted you wonder why the makers were shot out of a cannon into the sun yes jigsaw is quite possibly the worst movie ever made or conceived this coming from a guy who has seen campfire stories and fever lake the film starts out in some kind of college class what kind of class i am unsure but it is imagined to be an art class now these dorks have been given a final project by their idiot teacher five of them are given pieces of a mannequin and told to design it in any way they see fit and since there are only five pieces the other students in the class receive and automatic a oddly enough there are only six students in this entire class so the one goth chic gets a free a good for her a week passes and the five students plus teacher plus one hillbilly husband meet in a bar to discuss their and complete their project they put the pieces together head arms legs and inform the others why they chose their specifics designs now these creative geniuses used the week to their full advantage one puts a saw blade in the left hand the other gets a sawed off shotgun the right leg gets a bunch of broken ceramic glued to it and the left some magazine clippings the head is the worst getting a camera in the eye ala hellraiser with some bottle rockets for a stylish mo-hawk after they have all spilled their guts about their specifics designs the now drunk teacher says they are to burn the mannequin now aptly named jigsaw now up to this point it has been standard horrible movie fair bad acting dialog and everything else but has still been pretty plausible yet after jigsaw catches fire things take a turn for the worst jigsaw comes alive how you ask i have no idea he just does because the writers couldn t think of a realistic way for two pounds worth of molded plastic to become alive come on guys a bolt of lighting a traveling voodoo priest anything could have worked so once jigsaw comes to life he uses his new abilities of walking very slow and stilted with the use of his molded fingers to wreak havoc first he kills the cool guy with some barb wire this guy who was about to get it on with a hot chic decides drinking ground beer off in the distance is more important than what is in front of him with him gone jigsaw shoots the sexy girl in the face and then gives an old man a heart attack with a slight twist of his head he then saws up a nasty looking southern woman and then her hillbilly husband; jigsaw then kills the nerdy guy with some headless deception did i mention jigsaw was taking body parts off his victims to make a human version of himself no well its not important they don t even show his macabre creation they don t even show him steal away a torso from his poor creators maybe he was trying to create the head detective from in living color so after these five have been killed the teacher and the nerdy girl are all who is left the teacher figures out that jigsaw only needs a head to finish his masterpiece since he is still uninterested in that torso thing so being the coward he is the teacher ties up the girl as a sacrifice to jigsaw who comes in only to go for the teacher with his electric buzz saw which isn t even plugged in that is where the freaking movie ends we don t even get to see the teacher get killed or what happens to the girl let alone an explanation why jigsaw came to life or how he cleaned himself off after being burned this movie is so shameful it has too be seen it is only minutes so it is a small part of your day; for the memories of a lifetime jigsaw jigsaw jigsaw thank you total recall the judge has ruled watch jigsaw only if your plans of severing off your genitals seems played out 	NEG
time is precious this film isn t i must learn to ignore critics who rave about small films like fargo and this complete waste of time the theater was packed and everyone left with the same reaction: is this the film the critics are raving about what a piece of crap the hook of this film is the upwardly mobile black daughter seeking out and finding her white trash family get it the acting is superb the production lighting sets editing sound is about steps above a minutes story the characters are shallow and unintelligent i was insulted by the fact that these people could not figure out about each other what was blatantly obvious to the audience; the audience was murmuring to the movie screen what the characters should say next i have had more fun doing the laundry 	NEG
rumor has it that when the nasa technical advisors to this film were asked to keep the picture believable they laughed for several hours after all unless you are a politician or work crew the shuttle you are not going to get in the shuttle furthermore space cadet camp is in alabama not florida the truth is everyone on earth will win multi-billion dollar lottery prizes before the events depicted in this film ever become possible this film was meant for kids and had to have been written by one because they are not aware of the myriad restrictions and requirements regarding access to ksc ccafs this is the most useless film of all time and it was a well deserved flop 	NEG

even for a tired movie model as the nature vs man cycle that prevailed so predominantly in the s ants falls miserably short of being even somewhat effective though entertaining for reasons it was not intending it is sooooo preposterous apparently these ants that are bulldozed near an inn have been eating poisonous waste for decades and have now adapted by emitting poisonous bites - hundreds of these bites being fatal watching actors of some notoriety clumsily fall amidst tiny black specks is painfully funny in a not-so-good-but very-bad way so many scenes just look ludicrous: a boy trying to fall in a dumpster whilst being attacked suzanne sommers crying out in horror while lounging in bed robert foxworth and lynda george breathing through pieces of wallpaper bernie casey faking a gam leg and the list goes on and on the peril shown ranges from ants crawling from a drain to black lines of ants all over the walls the cast for the film is not bad on paper but none of these actors seem to believe in the material poor myrna loy has to sit in a wheelchair through this horror i hope she found a good use for the money for it is obvious that was the only reason a woman of her pedigree would be in this nonsense although it is quite a bad film it is watchable - once for me and does have many of those seventies bad film qualities - start-studded actors embarrassing themselves that made-for-tv feel and the dreaded creatures of nature reeking vengeance on man this time man must push his hand into a pile of ants to be affected really quite dreadful 	NEG
somewhere inside this movie is a half-hour episode from the twilight zone trying to get out whereas cube was taut well-made claustrophobic and mind-engaging i m afraid cypher is a bloated tedious rehash of several well-worn themes which just don t add up to much especially if you have seen almost any other half-way decent sci-fi film before cypher manages to drag all the way through its relatively short minutes right to the incompetent ending none of the characters spark off each other and for a film made in the technology is truly cheesy it is difficult to connect this tired and uninspired movie with the director of cube it s not a bad movie but it is most definitely not a good one when you ve watched the grass grow and paint dry and are bored of your stick insects then by all means watch this film but the other activities will probably prove more stimulating 	NEG
i always thought people were a little too cynical about these old andy hardy films a couple of them weren t bad modern film critics are not ones who usually prefer nice to nasty so goody-two shoes movies like these rarely get praisenonetheless i can t defend this movie either you can still have an dated dialog but still laugh and cry over the story watching this you just shake your head ask yourself how stupid can you get this is cornier than corny if you know what i mean it is so corny i cannot fathom too many people actually sitting through the entire hour-and-a-half the story basically is andy mickey rooney trying to get out of jam because he makes up some story about involved with some débutante from new york city as if that was the ultimate people were a lot more social-conscious in the old days you d hear the term social-climber as if knowing rich or beautiful people was the highest achievement you could make it life it s all utter nonsense of course and looks even more so today however it s about as innocent and clean a story and series there were a half dozen of these andy hardy films made as you could find also if you like to hear judy garland sing then this is your ticket as she sings a couple of songs in here and she croons her way into andy s heart oh man i almost throw up even writing about this 	NEG
this is just one more of those hideous films that you find on lifetime tv which portray the abhorrent behavior of some disgusting woman in an empathetic manner along with other such nasty films as the burning bed enough or monster this film takes a disgusting criminal and attempts to show the viewer why she s not such a bad person after all give us a break here s my question to the filmmakers: if letourneau were a man and vili were a year old girl would you have made a picture sympathizing and empathizing with this person answer: hell no imagine switching the genders in this film and then you ll see just why myself and others here consider this a worthless piece of garbage were the genders switched there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal instead we d likely be treated to a portrayal of a monstrous and hideous man preying upon a young girl his lascivious behavior landing him in prison and his brainwashed victim suffering from stockholm syndrome the only reason letourneau does not receive the same treatment in this film is by virtue of her sex let s call a spade a spade letourneau is a pedophile plain and simple no ifs ands or buts she s a criminal who belongs in prison and deserves our derision and contempt but certainly not our pity or empathy 	NEG

imagine that in adapting a james bond novel into a movie the filmmakers eliminated all the action and suspense in order to make it kid-friendly or if a television producer told chris rock he couldn t cuss so that his specials could be rated pg in the same way the director of the movie something wicked this way comes took out the excitement and gore in favor of melodrama for younger audiences this created a monotonous plot without the complications of the book in trying to make the story of something wicked this way comes easier for children to follow the filmmakers eliminated the theme of good and evil both existing in everyone and good always prevailing over evil this is apparent in will s character transformation charles halloway s rescue of jim and the carnival s defeat will s transformation into a more adventurous boy has been muted in the movie the scene in which the dust witch visits will s house in a balloon has been cut from the film instead a green mist follows jim and will home and gives them the same bad dream about the witch and her spiders the balloon attack shows us that will has begun to conquer his fear of doing things on his own he gets on top of a neighbor s roof and tears the balloon with a bow defeating the witch sorry dad he thought and sat up smiling this time it s me out alone will decides as he prepares to face her removing this scene from the movie prevents us from understanding that will is becoming more adventuresome the film shows us many examples of will being afraid to follow jim but never growing curious like his friend in the book will has both a good quiet side and an evil daring side like his jim in the movie each boy only has one mode of thought which destroys bradbury s theme of both good and evil being present in each person in the book will saves jim because of their friendship but in the movie charles halloway saves jim to repay jim s father will pulls jim off the carousel in bradbury s novel because he doesn t want his best friend to grow up without him it is the good in will the fact that he cares about his friend that saves jim from the evil curse of the carnival on the carousel jim gestured his other hand free to trail on the wind the one part of him the small white separate part that still remembered their friendship this shows that there was good left inside of jim which has the potential to still defeat evil but when charles halloway saves jim in the movie he does it to repay the debt he owes jim s father who saved will when he was a little boy by changing the motivation for saving jim the filmmakers have ruined bradbury s original idea that it takes good to win against evil in the end of the movie the carnival is defeated by a tornado and lightning instead of smiles and laughter when the book ends mr dark turns himself into a little boy and charles halloway smiles and laughs at him so much that he can t stand it and evaporates in bradbury s world evil people feed off fear and can only be defeated by happiness and love his message is that good will always prevail over evil but only if that goodness is expressed outwardly good to evil seems evil says charles halloway as he holds the dying mr dark so i will do only good to you jed i ll simply hold you and watch you poison yourself in the movie mr dark is the only one left on the carousel when lightning hits it and he dies by eliminating the weapon of laughter and smiles the filmmakers imply that bad weather is the most effective way to defeat evil as if lightning only strikes those who are bad this takes away the major theme of bradbury s book which is that doing good toward others wards off evil good may always triumph over evil but trying to make movies more kid-friendly will always force filmmakers to leave out some of the themes from the books they are based on in the movie something wicked this way comes will does not transform will s friendship does not save jim and smiles and laughter do not defeat the carnival as a result the filmmakers have left out too many of bradbury s main points the process of adapting a book to a movie too often ruins the world the author has established in the case of this story bradbury s frightening world of opposing forces of good and evil has been reduced to a tamer simpler version of itself 	NEG
this is one of the two postapocalyptic fantasy movies that albert pyun made in - and it s the bad one apparently all his energy went into nemesis which was an entertaining non-stop action movie and had a much more expensive look knights is clunky and cheesy a bottom-of-the-barrel sci-fi that too often resembles a video game new opponents pop up all the time and must be exterminated as quickly as possible the only thing that saves this movie from the trash can is kathy long; not a particularly attractive woman but undeniably a brutally efficient fighting machine as for kris kristofferson considering his age at the time i hope his stunt double was well paid 	NEG

first this movie was not that bad it was entertaining at least to me for probably all the wrong reasons i have never seen the original so can t compare the two this movie reminded me of that weird christopher reeve movie village of the damned the two movies have different plots but that creepy disgusted feeling and unwanted comedy exist in both the wicker man is suppose to be a mystery thriller men please don t anger the women movie i don t know the whole pagan thing and sacrifice was a little off nicholas cage his glorious bad self goes to a secluded island called summerisle when he receives a letter in calligraphy from his long lost fiancée who claims her daughter has been taken and hidden by fellow islanders cage is a police officer and being the weary policeman he is he goes to the semi uncharted island leaving no word of his whereabouts to anyone who is located in the real world stupid things get weirder when the large amish-esquire women who populate the island snarl at him and lie about the whereabouts of the missing girl his fiancée is no help who seems to be elusive and weary the whole time cage stays on the island when he learns that the missing girl is his daughter and he is the lucky man tricked to come to this island as a sacrificial victim during the islands sick harvest festival in this movie males do not fare so well a sick twisted display of feminism i found the movie laughable at times particularly when cage punches some women and runs around in a bear suit i think there were too many potholes in this movie i find the whole concept of angry women secluding themselves on an island without any care for males quite entertaining but the way it was portrayed in this movie was just weird while most women have had some jerk hurt and anger them this is clearly a form of sexism i would have turned the movie off in disgust if the roles were reversed this movie is something to watch maybe just once or twice it is not a thriller it should be categorized as just strange 	NEG

first of all i am not a huge fan of contemporary turkish cinema which is because the usual pattern of creating a box office success is by hitting below the waistline this movie is nothing of an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos as the director and marketing ads imply in my mere opinion the sole purpose of this movie is make money by touching a sensitive morale in fact it is mostly considered taboo in the native country cheap populism might provide with a brief definition of what i meant however the acting is near perfect in fact most of the cast has theatrical background and tried hard to compensate for what altioklar lacked; talent all members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job even the less experienced ones like janset at least altioklar deserves a small word of appreciation just because he knows well how to choose the cast other than that he is just a media monkey who presumes himself a director with an artistic talent come on art is not something that solely consists of dealing with naked half naked women and just because media boasts off no director becomes a milestone in the history of turkish cinema just close your ears and o something real artistic i am waiting eagerly to applause your next work hope this time you manage to achieve an artistic approach in short; pros > good acting hot women just kidding : cons> each and every single thing other than the cast	NEG
steven what have you done you have hit an all new low it is weird since steven s last film shadow man was directed by the same director who did this trash shadow man was good this was diabolically bad so bad it wasn t even funny steven is hardly in the movie and feels like he is in a cameo appearance and when he is in the film he is dubbed half the time anyway as for the action well let s just say the wizard of oz had more action than this trash there is hardly any action in the film and when it does finally arrive it is boring depressing badly shot so called action scenes seagal hardly kills anyone unlike his over films where he goes one man army ie under siege and and exit wounds the plot is so confusing with so many plot holes that it doesn t make scenes sometimes flight of fury better be good what a shame i wasted pounds on this garbage out of ten better luck next time	NEG
this movie is a loose collection of unintelligible analogies and ill conceived plot devices movie history: the director of this film was a pervert who drove around town filming random women when his wife discovered the film reels he was forced to quickly contrive a story he claimed he was making a movie called the brain that wouldn t die eventually his wife demanded that he show her his so called movie that night he quickly filmed some extra scenes with a friend and the brain that wouldn t die was born i hate this movie plot synopsis: the main character s fiancé is killed in a horrible car accident that he caused by ignoring the clearly posted road signs he grabs her head from the wreckage and reanimates it after reanimating the head he goes and picks up a bunch of hookers that is pretty much what happens for the rest of the movie at the end he fights and is killed by a monster that lives in the closet the monster appears with little to no explanation however the monster saves a hooker and i assume that they live happily ever after side notes: the end credit screen claims that the movie is called the head that wouldn t die i hate this movie 	NEG

this poor remake of the classic starts reasonably well then replaces suspense with muddled and pointless special effects for example in the original one of the most chilling moments occurs when nell and theo are lying side by side in twin beds listening in terror to the noises outside their room nell tells theo to let go of her hand because she is hurting her nell then looks across at theo who is several feet away and realises that it was not theo holding her hand in the latest version nell is lying alone in bed when suddenly she dives out and slides across the floor it is only when she tells the unseen force to stop pulling her that we realise what has happened and can anybody explain what nell s final words mean - it s about family it s always been about family the one redeeming feature is lili taylor s performance but even this cannot save the film catherine zeta-jones demonstrates once again that beneath her pretty exterior there is little depth in the original claire bloom subtly suggested her lesbian persuasion zeta-jones however has to spell it out for example by asking nell if she has a boyfriend - or girlfriend definitely one which should be consigned to the pointless remakes graveyard 	NEG
i was at first disgusted with director sun-woo jang because i had felt that he cheated me jang had the potential to create a strong deeply emotional film about sex and its effects on people but instead chose to focus his strength on the pornography element more than the actual human element i couldn t see the characters at first and his sloppy introduction which blended both realism and cinema together was amateurish at best  yet this film remained in my mind for days after i viewed it what stayed with me wasn t the story it wasn t the characters nor was it the apparent pornographic nature of the film but the transition that jang demonstrated between y and j if you watch this film carefully you will see that both begin in an exploration phase of their relationship eager to jump into the unknown but not quite certain the next step as they continue to meet exploring new avenues of pleasure they continually jump between the aggressor and the aggressed jang initially explores the idea that j is the one that in control of the situation then hauntingly the reversal happens when j becomes obsessed with y it is a very small change and due to the graphic content of this film it can easily be missed but it is there it becomes apparently clear near the end when j cannot live with y as their meetings become less frequent and j attempts to become a part of normal society this was a huge and very exciting element to this film to see right before your eyes but alas it was the only element of this film worth viewing i will ignore those that speak of this film as nothing more than pornographic because there are human elements at the core of this film as underdeveloped as they are they are there it is a film about a facet of our lives that is very rarely explored in cinema or talked about in the papers what happens behind closed doors is never known  or so we should believe while the act itself does becomes repetitive after a bit director jang tries to change it up a bit with some constantly changing scenery our characters are continually moving from hotel room to hotel room to best quench their thirst for each other s flesh this is fun at first but again jang s repetitive streak seems to make it feel boring than exciting this leads me to the biggest issue that i had with this film jang had a great story with gojitmal but where he failed outside of the obvious choice to focus directly on the pornographic side was that he took scenes repeated them time and again without changing in front of us to allow us to get to know the characters where was jang going with this movie did he want the sex to tell the stories or did he believe the characters would he failed in this sense because by the end of the film we know so little about y and j that we could care less how they resolve themselves the ending seems almost random at best as jang attempts to create a final resolution for our two absolute unknowns of this film i have to give jang some credit for trying but not much he attempted to create some sub-stories that would create the personal element that we were lacking but they just couldn t congeal well together y s brother and j s wife were those plot points but again due to him focusing so strongly on the sexual element these stronger sub-stories became un-rememberable and down-right dull maybe it was just how i viewed this film but outside of the sexual scenes nothing else worked together we knew nothing about j and y and that is why gojitmal failed finally i would like to say that this film could have benefited from having a strong score or a daftly remote music genre element to it to bring us the viewers closer to the emotions being felt by j and y from what i can remember and i am trying to push this film far from my mind i don t remember any musical undertones gojitmal may have been a stronger film if jang either stylized it with music or done something to allude towards our character s beings while i understand that he wanted the sex to speak for itself there was just a technical element missing from this film that may have quenched a stronger desire for more technically this was a poor film obviously an independent film in nature it felt more like director jang was trying to make symbolic references out of nothing instead of your typical independent of this nature i didn t see as much of a social message or human element like mentioned above i just felt like he threw this film together over the course of two weeks and understood that the sex would sell it enough this was no larry clark production; this was sub-par and definitely needed some further technical clicks to develop it stronger than the final release overall i think i could have liked this film and there were smaller elements that i did enjoy but i felt this film was rushed repetitive and played too much towards the taboos instead of breaking them the obvious pitfalls of this film can be seen by the last scene of this film when we are privy to how the title of this film was conceived our characters were uneventful our story was underdeveloped and we could have used something memorable to make what was happening between y and j into something more symbolic than sex to me jang was trying too much to capture art house meets pornographic  and it failed miserably this was not a film worth the time and effort that it took to make grade: out of 	NEG
this anime series starts out great: interesting story exciting events interesting characters beautifully rendered and executed not everything is explained right away dangling a proverbial carrot before the viewer enticing the viewer to watch each succeeding episode but imagine the disappointment to find that the sci-fi thriller giant robot adventure is only a backdrop for psycho-babble and quasi-religious preachy exploitation if you want to hear you re ok it s good to be you after being embattled with negative slogans and the characters negative emotions then this is for you if you want a good sci-fi flick that is simply fun to watch forget this one both the original and the alternate endings were grossly disappointing to me all that and this movie was too preachy 	NEG
other than the great cinematography by the marvelous james wong howe in the battle scenes this film is a true stinker this is the second film that i ve seen in recent days directed by alexander korda the first was charles laughton s rembrandt it was so lousy that i shut it off this one i m afraid is not very much better flora robson is as ugly as ever as queen elizabeth perhaps her performance as the virgin queen was good for standards but when you compare it to that of a helen mirren it is absolutely no match in robotic fashion robson states her lines her battle message to the english troops is so lackluster in spirit even a dashing laurence olivier can t save this utter piece of boredom future wife vivien leigh is in a supporting role here and she doesn t really convey anything here to think that scarlett was years later it s a shame that history with the spanish armada is made out to be so boring in this film 	NEG
i own this movie not by choice i do i was really bored the other day and the box intrigued me so i popped it in the old vcr and spent the next hour and a half of my life crying why god why the story-line was not that bad as an gamer i could appreciate bits of it i think that maybe if you re into super geeky-cheese romantic scenes you ll enjoy this film i always thought of myself as a vulcan you know like dr spock unable to love there is very few good things to say about this film truly it is awful but if you re up to really badly made film this is the one for you the real story s much more interesting though ; if i had to sum up this film in one word it would be:lame	NEG
first off let me say that i am a great believer in fanpro stuff i see it as a way to continue a good show long after it has been cancelled star trek voyages and star wars revelations are examples of decent efforts so i have a soft-spot for fanpro stuff that means i ll overlook things that i would ordinarily slate badly so on to st: hf well first off the good things enthusiasm is a major part of making any show believable and for the most part the crew of the various ships all seem to be having a good time with their roles next the effects aren t bad for a home-brew effort with nothing to make you really wince the stories aren t too bad either nothing particularly innovative but solid enough stuff and at least there are ongoing story-arcs but it has a lot of faults first off although they quite obviously have to rip-off star trek footage set backdrops music and effects i see no reason why they proceeded to rip off virtually every other sci-fi musical score ever made everything from aliens to starship troopers rears it orchestral head at one point or another likewise much of the footage is from other movies dutifully cgi d over to make it look different the grey warships for instance though disguised are quite obviously star destroyers from star wars and the station is also rather obviously fleet battle station ticonderoga from starship troopers likewise sound effects from various star wars movies appear in space battles between fighters as does animated over footage in one scene in either first or second season i think you even see two tie fighters fly past during a battle which hardly does your suspension of disbelief any favours acting varies from the reasonable to the hideously painful to watch everyone does improve as the seasons progress though but expect to grimace at the screen a lot especially in the early seasons they ve also made some interesting acting choices let s just say that the food replicators on this show seem permanently set to cake and leave it at that make-up effects are generally quite effective on the whole but they really ought to mercilessly club to death the person who decided to use cheap ferengi and cardassian masks for anything other than background use or passing shots they are just beyond unrealistic every time i saw one of these apart from trying not to laugh too much i kept expecting the unfortunate soul wearing it to pull out a gun and announce that this is a stick-up in one scene a cardassian actually talks whilst wearing one of these not only do the lips not move but the mask doesn t even have an opening where the mouth should be someone needs to be slapped hard for that couldn t they have taken a craft knife to it for goodness sake there are also some well-done but unintentionally funny make-up jobs such as the herman munster look alike the writing though coherent is nothing new instead the script runs like a continuation of ds with the ships heading out from ds on various missions the new enemy the grey aren t very menacing and the plot line involving them is effectively a reworking of the borg threads i e starfleet meet the grey the grey are hugely powerful starfleet barely escape with their lives then through technology they begin to find ways to combat the enemy etc etc all done before with the borg another bone of contention is the dialogue star trek writers have long had the ability to write insert technobabble here into a script it usually means an exposition of the latest plan to combat the enemy using quantum phase discriminators or isolytic charges etc in other words nonsense that tells you that they are on the case and a resolution is at hand the words are just gibberish really i ve no problem with this but where st:hf makes a mess of it is where they include real-world comments into this concept tactical advice such as we need to regroup sounds good but not when uttered by trio of characters already standing in a group likewise when asked what the situation is a tactical officer is heard to reply we count three battleships he actually needed to count them c mon i expected the questioner to ask him are you sure or can you double check but my all-time favourite comment is this: captain: can we establish two-way communication comms officer: no we can only send and receive well duh having said all the above the show does improve as it goes along seasons and are pretty bad shows an improvement but & are where it starts to get noticeably better season so far looks quite reasonable i do have a problem with their choice of media for the shows though quicktime sucks quite frankly and the sooner they move to divx avi format the better some of us like to actually take our downloaded shows and watch them on decent size screen and not peer at a tiny qt window on a computer monitor not only does quicktime make this difficult but the x resolution the shows are in does not scale at all well in fact it makes the shows pretty unwatchable like they were a tenth-generation vhs tape copy the least they could do was to include a hi-res downloadable option anyway the show has promise and i m even beginning to like some of the characters but that s episodes on so i m not sure this says that much about character development at all but what can you say it s free ps: out of votes people rated this show as a or hmmmm were we watching the same show or are you all three year olds 	NEG
nick cage is gates a treasure hunter oh excuse me treasure protector whatever that means who is descended from a long line of treasure hunters one of his ancestors had been given a clue to the whereabouts of a huge treasure that our founding fathers most if not all freemasons had decided to hide because they just didn t want to finance their independence all that badly the first clue turns out to be in a long-lost ship hidden in the arctic gates and his crew consisting of financier ian sean bean movie dork riley justin bartha of the immortal gigli and a couple of faceless lackeys enter the cargo hold of the ship they immediately spill out tons of gunpowder all over the floor not that this is significant in any way at last they find the clue a skeleton is hovering over it and it turns out to be a pipe with writing on it sort of don t ask me to explain it s a riddle and despite the fact that his expedition is clearly miffed at not finding the actual treasure gates wanders around yammering to himself about the meaning of the riddle in this frozen cargo hold while the crew just stands around slack-jawed i mean come on someone should have been a little vocal in their disappointment of coming all the way to the freaking arctic and not finding anything interesting but they just stand there as gates enters his own world solving the riddle the next clue turns out to be on the declaration of independence ian decides to steal it gates is appalled various characters deliver gratingly obvious exposition get used to it all this leads to ian s lackey pulling a gun on gates and the gunpowder going off in a big explosion oh that s why they spilled all the gunpowder huh ian and his henchmen make their escape and gates and movie dork riley walk nine miles in subzero temperatures to an inuit village in order to stop them to stop them gates concludes after trying the fbi and super archivist abigail chase diane kruger gates and riley must steal it themselves riley then tells gates in excruciating detail why they can not steal the declaration because it s so protected with metal and laser eyes and high tech security blah blah gates then tells riley that there s an opportunity to steal it from the preservation room does riley know what the preservation room is gates asks a place where they make jams and jellies i am not kidding; that s the actual line bartha doesn t deliver it like a joke either so riley does all this research about the library of congress and the archives and water and sewage fercryinoutloud but doesn t know what the preservation room is this pretty much indicates what level this script is on to make the rest of this short gates does in fact make off with the d of i in a ridiculous break-in that could only happen in a movie i also hate the way they depict computer monitor technology in movies -- full of improbable and impractical graphics and fonts abigail chase ends up tagging along for convenience s sake and as an obvious love interest angle at one point the three of them on the run from the law discuss all their plans really loudly in a clothing store surrounded by people a series of clues and the kidnapping of gates father played by a dyspeptic jon voight leads good guys and bad guys alike to a huge indiana jones fun-house located underneath new york city odd that the subway builders never found this thing gates and gates senior lead ian off on a wild goose chase ian believes they re trapped in a cul-de-sac and leaves them there however after they re gone riley asks how they re going to get out gates oh boy presses a button and a door opens no i m serious a button like they might have on a vacu-flush lavatory in an office building good thing he knew where that was anyway after some more knob-twiddling they find this immense treasure room remember this is all underneath manhattan full of all sorts of historyish golden things riley gets to deliver a really stupid line again and fbi officer harvey keitel forgives them arrests sean bean and allows the two chemistry-less leads to get married for any viewer i think it would be hard to ignore all the exposition the leaps of logic and the stereotyped characters for very long though some of its exposition involves nice history lessons inserted into conversation at random moments i d like more conversations like that in my life 	NEG
flame in flame out that seems to be gammera in a nutshell a prehistoric creature who can take it and dish it out with equal abandon i m not a fan of japanese monster films but wound up committed to viewing all the flicks on the fifty film dvd sci-fi collection put out by mill creek treeline films it s a great value at about twenty five bucks so at fifty cents per movie it really boils down to an investment in time to watch some of the goofy offerings gammera is riled from a centuries long slumber by a nuclear blast and he s not happy like godzilla he takes it out on tokyo setting the united nations into motion to try and come up with a plan to save the planet they arrive at plan z the hope of the world and wouldn t you know it there s a scene where a huge shed is shown that s called the z plan building; that was a nice touch by the mid s this country still wasn t quite politically correct one of the american military scenes at the alaskan air defense sector has general arnold asking a female sergeant to make coffee i guess there weren t any privates around good old gammera was quite the sight though walking around on two legs and going for the flame throwing routine when challenged that s why it surprised me how plan z managed to capture turtle man in the nose cone of a hidden space ship whisking him off to mars to save the world high fives all around for the american and russian team that made the save now let s get back to the cold war like godzilla gammera spawned at least a good dozen films but having seen this one pretty much satisfies my interest in flying flaming turtles especially since that dvd pack i mentioned earlier has attack of the monsters with a featured guest appearance by the big g it took all i had to make it through to the end of both films; it was such a relief to get to the final frame in this one that said gammera sayonara 	NEG

 for one of the worst swedish movies ever forgive me for being dull first of all i haven t seen the first one i was bored that s my reason for watching the nd before the st one well i hope the first one is better than this it was filled with weird cut scenes and very strange plot changes for the people that have seen this and think is high belive me so do i but it made me laugh a few times because it was so bizarre so bad and i still laugh thinking of the punk that came up with this idea what s next det sjunde inseglet ii sequels not based on novel or book doesn t turning out great to often and this is a perfect example of one ok i m gonna be honest with you: i did laugh a bit it got a few decent jokes in it and slapstick humor but don t buy it rent it just let some other idiot do it or download it this movie will be remembered and the director is probably laughed out already 	NEG
this film is a flagrant rip-off of one of the best novels of all time silas marner by george eliot the details of the film shown on imdb do give acknowledgement to the original authoress but i did not see this at the beginning of the film only a credit at the end of it saying suggested by the book silas marner suggested it was nothing but a complete rip- off of all the essential elements of the story:a wronged and sad old man an artisan poor and lonely has all his money stolen one night a child wanders up to his door as her mother lies dying in the snow outside the man takes her in and brings her up until one day the local squire or rich politician here demands to adopt the child it is he who has fathered the child during an illicit affair years before the battle then ensues as to who should have legal custody of the child in this and every other aspect of the film the story is exactly the same in only one can i find a difference silas marner had epilepsy - but perhaps that would have strained the acting abilities of mr martin too far on top of that he has his hair dyed in some carrot juice concoction presumably to make him look younger but actually making him look more the clown that he is there is also the addition of meaningless jokes that this offbeat comedian cannot resist bringing into the story which have no part in it and only detract from the profoundness of the story like when the child cries in the courthouse declaring she can only be happy with the man who has fathered her all these years this is conveyed in the film by the girl applying nasal decongestant to the bridge of her nose to make her tearful i am surprised that legalities and integrity within the film industry permit such a film to be made if i was a trustee of george eliot s i would insist on reparation if i was steve martin i would send the profits to that estate or to the poor at the very least it should be entitled silas marner - adapted by s martin or better still removed from the archives if you are interested in this story - and i hope you are - dismiss this completely and watch silas marner or read the book the bbc made an excellent adaptation of it in the s 	NEG
i am curious is really two films in one - half of it is the sexual experimental side of lena and the other half is her curiosity with political socialism whatever the director s intention the two don t really mesh together the director should have just stuck with the romantic side of lena and made a separate movie for the politics there is a bizarre mixture of political war rallies dr king serious political interviews flopping breasts and pubic hair the film feels more like a fictional documentary than a movie other than the interesting sex scenes you ll be bored dry watching this film unlike many other reviewers i think the nude sexual scenes are overdone for what it is if you want to see real porn i m sure there are better choices the pervasive nudity is a major distraction from whatever plot there is i think the cast did a fine job however they played their parts believably there is little of the over-the-topness i m so used to seeing in the american films during this time 	NEG
this film seems to be a rip off of many movies that have dealt with the same subject in the past let the future viewer be forewarned that art heist doesn t add anything to the genre director bryan goeres has no clue what to do with the film william baldwin keeps reappearing in films and frankly one wonders if he has a great agent or is it that directors and producers love his unusual goofy looks complimented by that strange hairdo he sports in most of his movies the only good movie in which he has appeared is the squid and the whale in which he only speaks two or three lines ellen pompeo his leading lady doesn t fare much better; there is no chemistry between ms pompeo and mr baldwin a movie to be seen at the viewer s own risk 	NEG
there are so many goofy things about this movie that i can t possibly name but a few:bogart s character: his name  whip mccord too easy so i ll leave it at that boy it makes `humphrey sound good his long curly hair and silly sideburns his black bart get-up complete with spurs not sure what shade of lipgloss they ve got him wearing but it ain t none too flattering cagney s character jim kincaid : his lipstick doesn t do him any favors either the man is being swallowed by his hat during the entire film could they not find a hat to fit him even a little his pants are too tight in the rear he blows the smoke off his gun one too many times if you know what i mean and i think you do if you are a casual bogart or cagney fan and figure it might be a change of pace to see them in a western do yourself a favor and forget that thought even the horses look embarrassed that is when they don t look bored in all fairness i admit that westerns are my least favorite film genre but i ve still seen much much better than this on a comedy level or as high camp the oklahoma kid works otherwise it s viewer beware therefore see this only if a you must see every western out there b you are a true cagney or bogie completist c any of the above comments appeal to you woah 	NEG

i love special effects and witnessing new technologies that make science fiction seem real the special effects of this movie are very good i have seen most of this movie since it s been airing on hbo for the past couple of months i must admit i may have missed a few scenes but i m usually drawn into movies and have seen some scenes more than once but every time i see some of hollow man i feel depressed almost like a film noir i m not sure why; perhaps it s that i don t want kevin bacon to be evil and there s disappointment in that but i think it s witnessing just how relentlessly evil he becomes regardless i can recommend this movie for excitement although some parts move slowly but i do not recommend for youngsters under the age of perhaps if they are mature 	NEG
germans think smirking is funny just like americans think mumbling is sexy and that women with english accents are acting i had to cross my eyes whenever the screen was filled yet again with a giant close-up of a smirking face one of those housewife hacks corporate mainframe tales where she defrauds a bank by tapping a few random keys on her home pc which is connected only to a power socket the director obviously loves the rather large leading lady can t say i share his feelings there s quite a funny bit when the entire family sit in front of the television chanting tonelessly along with the adverts apparently this review needs to be one line longer so here it is 	NEG

noting the cast i recently watched this movie on tcm hoping for an under-appreciated gem as i regard many films from the s this is no gem - not even semi-precious the anachronistic clothing and s rolls royce limo hit you immediately the casting is strange also but mostly there are too many dumb and unnecessary plot devices this film has lots of good ingredients and a basic plot that holds promise but the components aren t mixed according to the right recipe it simply doesn t come together like it should and that s a shame with a few rather obvious but minor alterations this might have been a very good movie the film is about an american showgirl jean harlow seeking a rich british husband - preferably from the nobility she meets franchot tone and his buddy who are on a lark in a rolls royce owned by his buddy s employer harlow mistakenly assumes tone is the lord who owns the rolls and she sets her sights on him this early part of the film is a light comedy of no real distinction however tone unwittingly uncovers the fact that his employer is actually a german th columnist on the eve of wwi and that is when the movie changes tone altogether and begins to fall apart tone and harlow are married but just as the honeymoon begins he is gunned down by a mata hari-type benita hume and harlow flees the scene with a bystander accusing her of tone s murder in fact tone recovers from the wounds harlow flees to france where she falls in love again - this time with a wealthy french cad cary grant tone now in the army and harlow are unexpectedly brought back together in grant s hospital room where he is in rehab from a plane crash in the following scene tone accuses harlow of abandoning him because she is essentially a gold-digger harlow never explains about the witness accusing her of murder and her panic that is one of those unreal movie-plot-device break-downs in the story then tone is also brought back into contact with the woman hume who shot him she is on hand to watch her paramour grant test the new plane that tone has delivered to him from england incredibly both hume and tone dimly recognize each other but simply can t place where from okay so tone was shot and almost died; perhaps his memory is a little out of whack but how many men did hume shoot that she would forget one of her marks she does not seem to be faking the memory lapse this is inexplicable and unnecessary hume should have absolutely recognized him but played it coy when she realized that tone wasn t able to place her that would have been a much better treatment of that issue the finale also is very unsatisfying the movie as made has tone and harlow conspiring to preserve the good reputation of the cad grant leading to his fraudulent burial as a hero then harlow and tone just walk away it is noble to preserve the french public s perception of their national war hero but very unsatisfying as a love story what the film begs for is this: harlow explains that she fled in a panic in the face of accusations of murder; tone forgives her and quietly rekindles his love for her; he then carries a torch for her even while helping her to rig the crash site to preserve grant s reputation meanwhile harlow finally recognizes grant for the cad he is then having seen tone for the brave and noble man he is harlow rekindles feelings for him too at film s end the two of them become reconciled even as they work together to rig the appearance of grant s death after grant s hero s burial we see them embrace and kiss at the fade-out that would have made a nice little movie for cary grant fans it would have been even better had tone played the french cad who is killed and grant the long-suffering first husband reunited with harlow it is incomprehensible that franchot tone is cast as the irishman living in england while cary grant is cast as the frenchman this movie would have been much better had they reversed roles that also would have been more conducive to the film that should have been 	NEG
this film lacked something i couldn t put my finger on at first: charisma on the part of the leading actress this inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play it could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors i just don t know but could it have been the screenplay just exactly who was the chef in love with he seemed more enamored of his culinary skills and restaurant and ultimately of himself and his youthful exploits than of anybody or anything else he never convinced me he was in love with the princess i was disappointed in this movie but don t forget it was nominated for an oscar so judge for yourself 	NEG
unlike endemol usa s two other current game shows deal or no deal and vs the pacing in this show is way too slow for what is happening on the screen dond and vs can get away with slow pacing because the games can change pace--or end--at any moment there is risk involved in every action the player takes the rewards are wildly variable and it is difficult for the players to leave with a significant amount of money suspense is usually put to good use show me the money on the other hand is just too slow-paced when a question is revealed and it is obvious that the player knows the correct answer you can rest assured that absolutely nothing exciting will happen in the next few minutes it would greatly help the pace of this show to reveal the correct answer first and then have the player select a dancer instead of shat wasting time talking about what will happen if the player gets an answer wrong when we all know they re right the random dancing is filler that actually feels like filler too much time is wasted while not enough is happening and the fact that players cannot choose to quit the game early guarantees that there will be a lot of time wasted oh and i have no interest in watching shat shake his groove thang especially right after i ve eaten dinner i am a lifelong game show fan but even i had a lot of trouble sitting through an hour of this it either needs major changes or early retirement 	NEG
it should first be said that i have read the manga and therefore my argument is based on the differences this anime greatly disappointed me because it removed the comedy and high quality action of the manga and ova what it left behind was merely a husk of what it could have been many of the characters lacked the depth that is seen in the manga alucard is not the sympathetic character that secretly wishes for death walter s story lacks the betrayal and the nazi villains that plot to engulf the world in war are completely absent instead the anime provides the gary stu villain incognito who is defeated against what appear to be all odds my primary complaint is not that the anime diverges from the manga but that it does such a poor job 	NEG
 st watched - out of dir - harold young : the rd universal mummy movie is about the same as the first two as far as the final result from the viewer s perspective the story is similar and the results are ho-hum this time the story s location is the u s as the egyptian priest s new follower sends a mummy to our country in hopes he can revive him to kill descendants of those who opened the original tomb this time the mummy is played by lon chaney which doesn t make much of a difference because he s really not asked to do much acting for this character the new priest becomes a morgue-keeper in the town and sends the mummy out to do his dirty deeds after feeding him the tanna leaf juice again a girl gets in the way as the priest falls for one of the descendent s fiancé and wants her yes--- to be immortal with him haven t we heard this before the plan is of course thwarted as the townsfolk hunt down the mummy with torches similar to the frankenstein monster and the burning of the creature ends the story how do they get a sequel i guess you ll find out with the next one in the series or not 	NEG
blank check is easily one of the worst films of the nineties the plot is completely pointless; its overtones of lonliness are pathetic do you really believe a twelve year old acting as a personal assistant for a millionaire could accomplish everything in this film like buying a mansion for a mere $ grand the notion let alone the bargain-basement price will only be believed by the most gullible viewers please respect your intelligence and don t watch this awful awful film 	NEG
this is without doubt rajnikanth s worst movies ever the first part is held in place with solid comedy from goundamani but it progressively gets worse and worse and completely illogical our hero also takes a dig at saints with the same name baba through a corny and utterly lame one-liner the first half has rajni uttering his usual array of oneliners and style and in the second half becomes a quasi saint after a beggar takes him through a interdimensional portal to the himalayas where babaji not the famous saints he took a dig at earlier gives him special powers for no apparent reason other than karma this is really starting to get interesting now isn t it the rest of the movie is about him wasting his magic boons and powers and fighting off politicians and related black magic the usual predictable crap with hilarious implementation oh and the black magic never worked on our hero because he just happened to have a param vir er shakti chakra with him the bad guys and the usual politician villains are clichéd overworked and in the end completely insignificant to the plot which itself doesn t go anywhere but despite all the flaws it was fun to kill time with and yell baba related one-liners during public events its also fun to watch others curse about this movie ar rehman is said to have composed the tracks for his movie through the cell phone thats how important he considered it rajni is very popular in japan and he has included two characters one of them is called keiko why not samsung of japanese origin in this movie just for the sake of it but the way they are portrayed dressed and treated is absolutely pathetic the japanese may stop watching rajni movies after seeing that this movie was probably promotional material for rajni entering politics but the results of the movie itself would have killed off any of his political dreams fun if you turn your brain off though 	NEG
if s exorcist ii: the heretic did him no favors it s hard to imagine what thespian extraordinaire richard burton saw in this drab exercise in non-thrills you ve seen it all before: burton plays a writer who discovered at an early age he possesses the power to move inanimate objects through force of his mind and you thought carrie had no impact on hollywood though adapted from a novel by peter van greenaway medusa plays like recycled goods though the special effects in the cathedral finale are solid if typical lee remick is somewhat present as a doctor but otherwise the supporting cast is extremely weak burton is hammy but weary not even telekinesis could save him at this point from 	NEG

there is no question as to who is in command of the training of cadets in this film: major chick davis pat o brien o brien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in the creation of a new kind of soldier from his cadets--the bombardier but he is not so rigid as to be unfair or unfriendly in fact he even changes his opinion as to the value of women working in the military he s tough when he has to be yet at other times he is a clear mix of coach and pastor roles he perfected in other films his character is the foundation of the action around which everything revolves o brien seems natural in the role and plays it in fine fashion two things help this movie: o brien s performance and the spectacular special effects ending 	NEG
the single worst film i ve ever seen in a theater i saw this film at the austin film festival in and it blew my mind that this film was accepted to a festival it was an interesting premise and seemed like it could go somewhere but just fell apart every time it tried to do anything first of all if you re going to do a musical find someone with musical talent the music consisted of cheesy piano playing that sounded like they were playing it on a stereo in the room they were filming the lyrics were terribly written and when they weren t obvious rhymes they were groan-inducing rhymes that showed how far they were stretching to try to make this movie work and you d think you d find people who could sing when making a musical right not in this case luckily they were half talking half singing in rhyme most of the time but when they did sing it made me cringe especially when they attempted to sing in harmony and that just addresses the music some of the acting was pretty good but a lot of the dialog was terrible as well as most of the scenes they obviously didn t have enough coverage on the scenes or they just had a bad editor because they consistently jumped the line and used terrible choices while cutting the film at least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the script until they added the hook of making it a musical i hope the investors make sure someone can write music before making the same mistake again 	NEG
i wanted to vote zero or lower i loved the commentary it is the worst movie ever made and unendurable is the perfect word for it unless there is something worse that roget never thought of i am also at a loss to think of anything negative enough to accurately describe bo derek the best that could be said of her is she s consistent 	NEG
the lowest score possible is one star that s a shame really i m going to lobby imdb for a zero stars option to give this film even a single star is giving way too much am i the only one who noticed the microphones dangling over hopper s head at the station and the acting or should i say the lack thereof apparently talent wasn t a factor when the casting director came to town my little sister s elementary school talent show provides greater range and depth of emotion and those fake irish accents were like nails on a chalk board the only thing that could have made this movie worse would have been oh wait no no it s already as bad as it can get 	NEG
i actually like asylum movies i ve made it a habit to see as many as possible even the rip-offs they ve done have been cool like exorcism and when a killer calls this is just plain lame i can t believe that the same people who made dead men walking and dracula s curse actually made this movie too it s not even laughably bad like jolly roger or alien abduction which by the way are pretty bad this is just bad i mean i can appreciate and or forgive bad acting or lame special effects in an asylum movie but this film takes itself way too seriously i really hope that snakes on a train is better now that s a movie i can t wait to see 	NEG
 the bat people is a really bad film that deserved the mst k treatment just as well like that other film the creeping terror in it we are in some sort of mountainous terrain full of bats we see many things happen like bats flying out and attacking and stuff station wagon chases mishaps at the emergency room and much more all this plus the cheesy mediocrity of the s hey think mitchell here making the bat people actually one of the very best of the last mystery science theater episodes made in the series moviewise it s awful it should be avoided like the plague unless tom servo and crow are watching with you the bat people - more like the bad people lol of course 	NEG
and not in a fun-to-watch way it s just bad it s shocking that people have posted positive things about it here the story sucks the acting is bad it s not scary the special effects aren t special--oh no the blackboard has hands coming out of it oh gee--the mirror turned into water the hair clothes and makeup in the s scenes aren t accurate and they got a middle-aged man with a receding hairline to play the high-school version of himself this is like later-on nightmare on elm street stuff i enjoy sitting down to watch a cheesy horror movie as much as anyone else but there are better bad ones out there to choose from 	NEG
this film was made and cast from my home town i remember the fuss about it and the whole hullabaloo about the fact molly ringwald was in town storyline essentially years after a film was laid to rest without being finished a group of film students set out to complete it - with dire consequences it would seem someone does not want the film completed the storyline is flimsy one has to remember that this is a comedy and therefore has to be taken a little tounge in cheek but it had no real oomph the characters are mostly transperant and the little info that you recieve about them you just don t care about it seems irrelevant it is weird hearing kylie s accent as australian again and nice to see a kid i went to school with in a starring role but that doesn t redeem the film at all goodness knows why the makers thought they would get in molly ringwald perhaps due to the nature of the film it sort of pays homage to s films bad horror films but really an aussie actor would have done just fine as far as casting is concerned a lot of the acting seemed constipated some of these kids especially the two main chics - they played director and producer looked like they were trying to act that is never a good look also the shots had a rough feel about them over lit perhaps just not as smooth as one is used to the killer lord could it be less frightening there are some shock factors though and a couple of gross scenes i did like the film but it was not great it went for minutes but could have gone for less perhaps if they had tightened the script it would have been better they had a lot of characters get killed - but no real build up to them getting slayed maybe if they had killed less people and actually concentrated on a scary atmosphere it would have been better now i know it is a comedy and elements were funny or so unbelieveable they were funny but i am not convinced lm 	NEG
slaughter high is intrinsically your emblematic s slasher flick a prank goes out of hand leaving a geeky guy horribly burnt a few years later the geeky guy returns and starts killing the people who hurt him now the story might sound intriguing and very entertaining but what makes this horrible film so different from the rest of the s slasher flicks is that it has some humorless flaws and continuation errors the acting is horrendous however actually not as bad as one would suspect though it doesn t help that every character in the film are so grody and unlikable the lead carol manning caroline munro is the easily the biggest tormentor of them all and she s the one that we are ostensibly supposed to share compassion and root for not to mention the geeky guy is almost too geeky and i think that even stereotypical geeks themselves would be rudely maddened and just downright antagonized by how geeky he his so when he gets mauled does anyone really care there is much unintentional laughter potential munro s lack of acting talent is quite apparent which puts her down at the same level as the rest of the awful cast however the most amusement is easily when the film poorly attempts to pose munro who is in her mid s at the time as a teenager amongst a cast of teenagers and then when it comes to later life and munro is playing around her real age the rest of the cast do not pass as adults this all goes well with a theme song that is a hilariously pose of heavy metal thrash accompanied by maniacal laughter and a voice shrieking i ll get you with that being said slaughter high really isn t a very good slasher flick but it does have a bad cheesy entertainment value to it perhaps an essential for hardcore slasher fans but don t expect dilemma suspense or any credibility from it horrible 	NEG
after the reasonably successful masti which was tad better inder kumar returned again with a comedy pyaare mohan based on the hollywood film see no evil hear no evil the film reminds you of hum hai kamaal ke where kader and anupam play the blind and deafthis movie is a tedious exercisethe film has jokes of such nonsense that you don t feel like laughing like snehal dabi s head getting stuck in the back of the horse and all those type comedies which we don t laugh at now but mock the film starts off in a clichéd manner and some scenes are funny sadly such moments don t last long as the story never moves in this half even the comedy gets boring the twist is well handled and the second half becomes an action film where the blind guy and the deaf go to rescue the heroines and we have all ott chase scenes and fight scenesdirection by inder kumar is bad music is okay one song stands out i love you my angelvivek is awful in the comic scenes his timing is very bad and is okay in serious scenes for some reason he keeps doing comedy and ruined his career fardeen khan is tad better but too wooden amongst the rest esha and amrita are the heroines boman irani annoys here snehal dabbi is okay	NEG
film starts in japan in which a man slashes his wife and her lover to death and the commits suicide it s a very gory bloody sequence then it jumps to present day well to be precise ted edward albert wife laura susan george and their annoying little kid move to japan for hubby s work they rent a house and--surprise surprise--it just happens to be the house where the murders took place the three dead people are around as ghosts the makeup is hysterically bad and make life hell for the family sounds ok--but it s really hopeless there s a bloody opening and ending and nothing happens in between there is an attack by giant crabs which is just uproarious they look so fake--i swear i saw the strings pulling one along--and they re muttering there s a pointless sex sequence in the first minutes probably just to show off george s body another one about minutes later but that was necessary to the plot and a really silly exorcism towards the end the fight scene between albert and doug mcclure must be seen to be believed as for acting--albert was ok as the husband and mcclure was pretty good as a family friend but george--as always--is terrific in a lousy film she gives this film a much needed lift--but can t save it i m giving this a just for her and the gory opening and closing that aside this is a very boring film 	NEG

sam thomas cavanagh and gray heather graham are devoted siblings who share an apartment and a love of many things -- ballroom dancing s movie musicals and much to their surprise an attractive woman named charlie bridget moynahan historically heterosexual gray is confused by her new feelings gray matters proves to be one of the blandest films i have ever seen it s dull predictable unfunny poorly acted and poorly written nothing about it felt real and everything was very cheesy also this isn t really a romantic comedy with a special twist but more of a coming out movie sue kramer tried to make the first half cute with the romantic stuff and the second half serious with the actual acceptance and coming out part unfortunately she failed miserably the first half was largely unfunny and only heather graham was able to hold it up a little then the film took an awkward tone and got all serious the serious scenes were handled poorly and all of the emotions just felt phony i guess i would have enjoyed the film a little more if the relationships between the characters felt more authentic the brother and sister relationship was very weak and they didn t really appear to be that close their relationship just didn t feel very natural also the relationship between tom and bridget felt very unnatural if two people are going to get married after only knowing each other for less than a week then you would expect to see a little more excitement but the characters talked about getting married in vegas in the same manner of asking a waiter what the specials are there was a lack of excitement in the film and it was hard to get involved with the movie with such unmotivated characters the acting was mostly weak which was a bit surprising given the decent cast heather graham gave the only good performance in the movie she was funny and had a few charming scenes but it s too bad that all of her co-stars were complete duds bridget moynahan was very weak and her performance ringed false on every level also it seemed like she was reading her lines thomas cavanagh was pretty wooden and he showed nearly no emotion the chemistry between thomas and heather was non existent and that damaged the film because their relationship felt phony i can usually rely on molly shannon to be funny in a supporting role but here she was just annoying sissy spacek had about two scenes and she was annoying in both of them finally alan cumming just had an embarrassing character and his performance wasn t very good overall gray matters is a lame film and it isn t worth watching rating 	NEG
i should have known i was in trouble with casper van diem as the lead character words cannot describe nor do they do justice to just how terrible this movie was but please allow me to try to describe it: horrible acting terrible dialog corny situations and through it all you get the feeling that you are being force-fed the beliefs and propeganda from the trinity broadcasting network its a weak attempt at trying to show hollywood that a movie can be entertaining and have a deep religious message attached to it they failed miserably it was clearly the worst movie i have seen in a long time 	NEG
one may ask why the characters snarl yell and chew the scenery without any perceptible reason except someone wanted to make a movie in barcelona billie baldwin is that the right one is forgettable in the cop estranged-husband loving-father-of-cute-little-blond-girl role the story seems to have been cut and pasted from the scenes thrown away from adventure films in the last three years ellen pompeo s lack of charisma is a black hole that seems to suck the energy out of every scene she is in her true acting range is displayed when she takes her blouse off as the movies careens from one limp chase scene to another unfortunately the directing rarely goes bad enough to be camp or a parody it is all just cliché familiar in every respect the director cast his own daughter as the precocious brat probably because no respectable agent would have permitted a client to ruin a career by being in such a lame contrived and uninteresting movie the only heist here is the theft of the investor s money and the viewer s time 	NEG
this could be one of the worse movies i ve ever seen i don t see how could this ever be described as a horror movie or even a thriller its more like a lumbering drama the scary music is excellent but since there weren t any scary situations the director thought it would be a good idea to use it for everyday activities like taking a dump or walking down stairs the movie had so much potential they had beautiful cinematography sp and interesting characters but it seemed as if the writers assumed you already knew them they would undergo peculiar activities without explanation or even a clue at what they meant this is simply one of those movies that says its about one thing and it something totally different 	NEG
description: corny utterly stupid and worthless it s so cheap and lame it ll make you wonder why these abnormally dumb people even wasted months or so to spend a budget i m guessing this probably no more than dollars to make this movie it was just hysterical to watch with or without mystery science theater i am giving you the best advice in the world:spare yourself spare your time life and money by not--i repeat not even ponder about whether you should see this movie this movie is so corny it ll make your face turn purple of outraged boredom if you have a one-digit iq then be my guest and watch this absolutely despicable movie you might actually admire it like i said before if you have a one-digit iq with about actors of your own a few puppets you bought at a garage sale and of course cameras and music i gaurentee you ll make a slightly more entertaining home video than this piece of absolute crap 	NEG
actually the movie is neither horror nor sci-fi with a very strong christian religious theme this movie delivers minimal content and no suspense second-tier actors do half-decent jobs of reading their boring roles the only good performance is by sydney penny who plays a role of a mother of i won t spoil the movie it s either christ or anti-christ avoid watching this movie unless you a christian religious fanatic obsessed with apocalypse being a non-christian i had to force myself to watch this movie just because i wanted to write this review it s a pity that sci-fi channel had to air this movie at the peak evening time 	NEG
this is one of the worst movies i have seen recently when a man says that he wishes he had a super power of being able to orally pleasure himself i pretty much consider the movie to be in the realm of childish year old male fantasies the bed room scene was over the top and reduced an intimate moment into a farce of biological functions akin to passing gas in public from the first every other scene was a discussion about how little sex they where getting how long its been since they got some when their next sexual liaison will be and with whom it should be with on top of that the dialogue and acting was very poor and very forced not felt and they filled their lack of content with sleazy sex scenes this could have been really funny because the concept is actually interesting but it is poorly executed here please do not even think about taking anyone under if you have to go and see it 	NEG
this snarky homophobic thing was dated in it seems particularly mean-spirited now filled with gay stereotypes and characters that are meant to be laughed at rather than with redd foxx does his standard schtick michael warren at least tries to bring humanity to a one dimensional character and pearl--pearl what were you thinking-- pearl bailey deserves far better 	NEG
i m sorry but this may have been scary in when it came out but in modern times it just doesn t hold up the only interesting scene in the entire movie is the opening scene where michael kills his sister judith wearing his halloween mask the most startling moment in the whole film is when his parents rip the mask off to see their son killed their daughter the film goes downhill from there and doesn t pick up until the last fifteen minutes but by then it s too late we the audience have lost all interest in the story there is barely any character development and people always rave about laurie being such an exceptional heroine when there really isn t much to her i m sorry to disagree with everyone terrified by this movie but if you want a great horror movie go watch the shining or rosemary s baby those are the two best horror films ever made halloween is certainly not in their ranks i can t believe roger ebert gave it four stars for there is no way this film could ever deserve such a high rating 	NEG
i can t believe i wasted my time with this movie i couldn t even call it a movie it was so bad with nothing to recommend it i like low budget movies and weird flicks but this one had me bored to death badly made and bad acting ruined it from being curious you have to wonder what these people were thinking when they spent money to produce this movie i wonder what i was thinking watching it to the end i recommend this movie to no one how did they release this was there an audience who likes this kind of movie there must be because you can find this at almost any video store but why deserves to be forgotten if you like bad movies then this is for you 	NEG
absolutely laughable film i live in london and the plot is so ill-researched it s ridiculous no one could be terrorised on the london underground in the short time it is not in service each night there are teams of maintenance workers down there checking the tracks and performing repairs etc that there are homeless people living down there is equally unlikely or that it s even possible to get locked in and not have access to a mobile phone in this day and age the worst that s likely to happen if someone did find themselves there after the last train is that they might get graffiti sprayed on them although this has been coming under control due to the massive number of security cameras on the network another thorn in the side of the story remember in london as a whole we have more security cameras than any other city in the world if it had been set in a city i am not familiar with perhaps i could have enjoyed it through ignorance but it s not a high quality film so i just couldn t bring myself to suspend my disbelief and try and enjoy it for the banal little tale that it is i would have given it if such a rating existed possibly the most disappointing film i ever thought i would like 	NEG
remember the name kevin lime - and please please never lethim direct again timing pacing editing: all hopelessly wrong three or four decent professionals next time guys walk off theset can do nothing to save this film from amateurs like aliceevans and the kind of production standards you d expect fromteen-produced children s shows on british tv greatest mystery: the music a score so inept inappropriate andill-matched to the tone of the film that one seriously wonders if it isa case of sabotage add an acoustic that booms apparentlyunengineered from a single mike and a director who onlyintermittently remembers to add auditory action offscreen and wehave what must be on of the greatest ratio of money to result ofrecent years 	NEG
first and foremost zorie barber zeke might be one of the worst actors i have ever seen as a character that s supposed to be a hip village writer into the martial arts and proud of being mysterious why is he so hyper over-dramatic and plain horrible did he know anything about his character before they started filming did the director don t the martial arts teach discipline aside from that this film misses the target with its lame jokes and seen-it-already gross-out humor hand in toilet trainspotting masturbation hmm fast times at ridgemont high american pie the list goes on bad dialogue: in one sequence eric says it s none of my business but and seconds later mia says why is this any of your business bad editing: at least five minutes worth of film are wasted on nyc traffic shots it s also impossible to believe that the four main male characters would be a tight-knit group of friends in any world i can t comment on what makes everyone laugh but if you enjoy low-brow basic bathroom humor and insults by all means enjoy if you want something a little smarter but on the same lines see boomerang if you want a solid what-goes-around romantic comedy go for the tao of steve but anyone who thinks whipped is witty and an accurate portrayal dating well i cannot agree at all 	NEG
in the questionable comedy vein of mel brooks wholly moses tries to take the bible story of moses and make fun of it resulting in the unfunniest biblical spoof ever filmed there is no real plot here just excuses to trot out stalwart comedy talent in underwritten roles dudley moore and laraine newman are on a bus tour of the holy land when they stumble across an ancient scroll in a cave there they read the story of herschel and zerelda also played by moore and newman herschel s life parallels moses he was sent down the river to be found by the pharaoh s family at the same time moses was herschel s birth father the late james coco becomes herschel s slave after herschel is rescued by idol makers and works as a sculptor eventually herschel comes to work for the pharaoh as an astronomer is banished and ends up tending moses flock of sheep herschel and moses are brothers in law marrying sisters and herschel thinks god has chosen him to free his people in egypt of course moses was receiving the divine word but herschel misunderstood i ll pause here to laugh hysterically pause anyway the rest of the film is a series of badly written scenes involving moore and actors who are making special appearances these scenes do not propel the plot forward they bring what little story there is to a grinding halt jack gilford plays a tailor dom deluise has maybe three lines when he meets herschel in the desert john houseman is an archangel just giving the same line readings he gave in the paper chase david l lander is a fake blind man healed by herschel andrea martin is one of zerelda s sisters i was not sure who madeline kahn was supposed to be she gives a ride to herschel and has about a minute and a half of screen time john ritter plays a very unfunny devil richard pryor has one scene as the pharaoh but it was obviously shot at a different time than moore s scene because the two do not appear onscreen together in the end zerelda turns into a pillar of salt after looking back on new sodom s destruction ha ha herschel writes the ten commandments and gives them to moses who is basking in all the glory in the final scenes the screenwriter decide to try and salvage this shallow film by having herschel bait god into an argument god comes off as an all powerful bully who was leading herschel around for his own amusement speaking through him only to give him the ten commandments we even have zerelda quip god works in mysterious ways thereby excusing everyone s very unchristian behavior during the film this film is not funny there is nary a laugh to be found anywhere at least monty python made fun of many established religious mainstays in life of brian in addition to their questionable take on jesus life but here the humor consists of poo poo jokes and characters constantly bumping their heads this makes mel brooks look like merchant ivory churchgoers will be offended not by the film s attitude toward religion but by the smugness the movie exhibits impressed with their own hoitytoityness i know not a word on a subject they obviously know nothing about wholly moses is wholly bad and an embarassment to all involved i suggest you read the book instead this is rated pg for some physical violence profanity sexual references and adult situations 	NEG
well i couldn t even enjoyed this movie much for its cult values it s a b-movie action-flick by the director of commando that is however far too lame and silly to consider it a good b-movie with enough entertainment value in it it s an s flick but foremost the movie should remind of an s action movie when these type of b-movies were at an all time high these movies always went over-the-top and never paid much attention to its story or acting it was all about blowing stuff up big muscle heroes and bullets flying around this movie has all of that ingredients in it but yet i really didn t liked watching this movie as much as i like watching some similar type of movies hard to say why really since the story and acting and such are just as bad as would be the case in basically any other genre movie from the same era it s probably because the movie is being often far too silly all these type of movies have its silly moments but this movie is just filled with it the fighting dolph lundgren running around shirtless the characters the story it all just isn t very good because it s often just too lame for words the story at times isn t even trying to make a bit sense and what s even the main plot-line of the overall movie its story is all over the place really and seems only to be written to create a movie out of with fighting sequences gun fights and such and those sequences aren t even much good to watch really the moments are way too short and quite disappointing to watch really from the man who brought us commando it s foremost a dolph lundgren in which he gets to play the big action hero star who kicks butt with seemingly relative ease knows how to handle guns and other weapons and of course also gets the girl played by tia carrere this all also brings us one of the worst montage sequence in action movie history and also definitely one of the worst sex sequence i have seen in any movie really both are just too lame for words and just very poorly put together none of the characters work out really the good guys are cops but they never seem to behave like one they simply kill around without having to face responsibility to anyone and they are not very keen on making any arrest or to inform anyone about their discoveries not even when they find out a big japanese crime syndicate is trying to take over the streets of l a and a beer brewery is working as a cover for a drugs factory and large scale drugs smuggling and also just think about it for a moment what is brandon lee s overall purpose in the movie the movie could had easily done without him and the girl as well too silly lame and simplistic and just not entertaining enough 	NEG
the movie opens upon julian sands lying on his back a black kitten drooling blood into his awaiting mouth from where he holds it about two feet above him that was so provocative and i thought here we go a good vampire movie and then it died that was literally the only scene which captured any part of the imagination it was slow uneventful drivel thereafter i was vastly disappointed as my previous experience with sands acting was quite enjoyable however this attempt was obviously misdirected and the screenplay left a lot to be desired even julian sands s questionable performance could not begin to save this already sunken barge of a movie it rates a from the fiend : 	NEG
i was utterly disappointed by this movie i had read some of the other reviews here and had much higher expectations i expected a drama with more intense character development but that never happens in the movie daniel-day lewis is a good actor but not as good as some reviewers here would have us believe i tought he repeated the same set of or movements in the movie i would rate his performance out of acting: out of direction is out of script is the worst: out of i deleted the movie from my dvr at mins into the movie much better movies out there than this 	NEG
i have walked out of very few movies before they end but i couldn t finish this piece of garbage this was the biggest load of racism trying to pass as legitimate film since birth of a nation the characters were little more than cardboard cutouts i don t see how any actor would want their name associated with this film lee must have better things to do that put out garbage like this i know that i and anyone with a brain have better things to do like watching paint dry i wish that someone would make a film about interracial relationships that dealt with the topic realistically there is a lot more depth to this subject the shallow ranting of a bitter director like lee 	NEG
first of all as a long time student of the titanic disaster and member of several titanic clubs i feel entitled to comment on the film i don t really care how many awards and accolades the film won but to me it is still an absolutely awful film cameron had the resources to make a proper semi-documentary film of the disaster but unfortunately chose to turn it into a po-faced romantic mush the fact that so many people around the world fell for it only shows to my mind the sad state of taste and common sense that movie critics and audiences have these days whoever said that all movies should have a hero and heroine falling in love in fact most real events are anything but romantic and the titanic disaster certainly was not one i feel that it needed a better script and director with a semi-documentary approach and as little artistic license as possible i almost threw up in the last sequence where the dead lovers meet among the other lost passengers and crew who break out in applause is this an intelligent film ask yourself 	NEG
i am writing this review having watched it several months ago the trailer looked promising enough for me to buy this lame excuse for a movie it is a complete joke and literally a spit in the face of real classics of the early generation of horror like texas chainsaw massacre which they even had the gall to compare itself to on the back of the cover art the producer who played brandon should go flip burgers and serve up greasy hamburgers hell he might not even be good at that either the lighting was bad bad bad and a big annoyance through out the film you couldn t even see the actor s faces sometimes i don t even remember the rest of the cast members which is sad really bad they never do anything to impress you to make them memorable that s all the time i will waste on this review please stay as far away as you can from this pile of junk even if you get it for cents don t do it buy s piece of gum at least it would keep you entertained if you want good quality low budget fun far better than this then check out a jeff hayes film because it takes talent to make it in horror and the kid has it i gave this star just for the cover art thats the only thing worth liking abut this so called film -rick blalock	NEG
i love westerns i could watch them all day the good the bad and the ugly is my all time favorite i watched silverado for probably the th time just the other day because it was being featured on cmt however this movie shiloh falls is without a doubt the worst western i have ever watched the acting was terrible all around they explain nothing at the end of the mysterious compass looking thing the only good part i can think of is the good-looking cantina girl the very noticeable long pauses between the dialog seemed intentional just to make up time to make the movie of acceptable length this movie wasn t even worth the new rental fee i paid at our local movie rental store i felt like i was robbed and deserving of a rental refund if there was such a thing only reason i finished it was because i hate to not see a movie through to the end i turned it off half way through because it was so bad to the director please do a better job if you decide to make another this is the kind of movie that has the potential to turn people off to westerns 	NEG
very very humdrum movie fare here with stella stevens taking directions from someone in disguise it didn t take me long to guess who it was in old nevada town outside vegas for a money heist in the circus circus hotel in las vegas stevens leads her girl gang of three and they find out that they must act much quicker than had been anticipated despite some neat looks at las vegas in the s very average yet credible acting from most involved and a plot line with potential las vegas lady lays one big boring egg it seems forever for the film to kick into gear and when it does it just sputters here and there and never really speeds up i was somewhat disappointed with this film sure i wasn t expecting anything great but i at least thought this might be one of those neat exploitation films from the s or something like it not even close no one dies there is a lame gunfight between creaky stuart whitman and officious george dicenzo one year prior to his grand performance as the prosecuting attorney bugliosa in helter skelter the gunfight has all the suspense of watching a waterfall there is one punch and one head hit with a blunt instrument beyond that nothing in terms of action and as for the girls don t expect much there either stella and her girls both very mediocre yet pretty talents get in a sauna and a bath what do we see nothing but a fleeting side profile stella wears these nice open blouses accentuating her real talents but i wish she would have been a bit more open with her performance that way i could write one thing that would recommend the film alas it was not to be and i have little to say in this film s favor it isn t a horrible film in any way it just has nothing going for it either yawn 	NEG
this movie s one of my favorites it s not really any good but it s great to laugh at the dialogue can become incredibly ludicrous and poorly acted eg manji can we ask you a few questions sure we think you can help us with the answers any fighting is more or less surrealistic make sure to watch for brock the oafy white guy who attacks the main characters he only has two lines but he s one of the best guys in the movie 	NEG
i like billy crystal and i thought it would be fun to watch this film since i know he admired alan king and they would be funny together i thought i had seen all billy s movies but couldn t remember this one and now i know why it s so full of clichés and phony emotion; you can smell each scene coming and going billy doesn t even get to be funny very often he s too busy trying to cry fake tears or show his angst at how badly his father let him down alan king himself is fairly likable as is the subplot about being an extra in the movies but what a coincidence that billy just happens to visit his father just as a major health crisis takes place etc etc or that two busy doctors can just shut down their practices to moon around in la and when the end comes boy does it come quickly almost as though the writers realized they had painted themselves into a corner and the only way out was to do a death scene mostly disappointing with a few glimmers of good humor 	NEG
my dad is a fan of columbo and i had always disliked the show i always state my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is but he goes on watching it none the less that is his right as an american i guess but my senses were tuned to the series when i found out that spielberg had directed the premier episode it was then that i was thankful that my dad had bought this show that i really can t stand i went through his dvd collection and popped this thing in when i came home for a visit from college my opinion of the series as a whole was not swayed but i did gain respect for spielberg knowing that he started out like most low tier directors and that is making small dribble until the big fish comes along get the pun ha ha like spielberg did it s like jesus before he became a man or thats at least what i think that would feel like any ways if your fan of columbo than you would most likely like this even though it contains little of peter falk i attribute this to the fact this is the start of the series and no one knew where to go with it yet this episode mainly focuses on the culprit of the crime instead of columbo s investigation as many later episodes would do 	NEG
there have been very few films i have not been able to sit through i made it through battle field earth no problem but this this is one of the single worst films ever to be made i understand whoopi goldberg tried to get of acting in it i do not blame her i would feel ashamed to have this on a resume i belive it is a rare occasion when almost every gag in a film falls flat on it s face well it happens here not to mention the sfx look for the dino with the control cables hanging out of it rear end halfway through the film i was still looking for a plot i never found one save yourself the trouble of renting this and save minutes of your life 	NEG
i watched the movie and was dismayed to say the least that the movie failed to communicate with me as an audience the language would put to shame the street loafers the plot; a father forcing none of his son to marry seems far-fetched the idea of a grandmother asking her grand kid to mess up with an enemy would only draw feeble minded s attention and i was waiting the whole movie for a laugh and laugh i did on my stupidity to waste hours to convince myself that the movie is not even worth a first look hope it saves your time 	NEG
if this movie was written directed and produced with the intention of creating a bad movie cult classic it might i say might have been a hit have you ever sat and watched a movie that was so absolutely awful that it becomes fascinating in terms of its faults well this is it every one of the acting cast should be nominated for worst acting performance awards it would be hard to find another film with this kind of production budget that contains so little of any value whatsoever the whole thing from the opening scenes defies logic dialogue is completely unbelievable and illogical ditto for the behaviour and general storyline of the film itself what is really mind boggling is that some buffoons in a boardroom actually made decisions to spend money on this piece of trash wow 	NEG
if i only had one camera that was accidentally glued to the floor enough film for only one take of each shot and then lost all that film and had to scrounge up some bucks to buy a few digital video tapes and was forced to make an over- -hour movie about the french revolution and also didn t have any sets and had to have my -year-old autistic son paint the backgrounds and also the only actors i could find were the people who didn t make the auditions of that year s soap opera and i was also forced to not use any music in the entire film and also the zoom function on the camera didn t work except for one time when it accidentally started zooming in and couldn t stop oh and if i hated my audience then i might make something kind of like this awful yet mistakenly hilarious hell-worthy waste of time the almost grand looking but completely fake looking backdrops reminded me of some of george lucas latest creations which made it so much more disappointing because through the whole movie there was that little glimmer of hope in the back of my mind that the film would climax in a lightsaber duel space laser battle i don t mean to spoil the movie for those who haven t seen it but that s not how it ends the only thing i can think of that wasted more time than watching this movie was writing this review peace 	NEG
the movie gung ho : the story of carlson s makin island raiders was made in with a view to go up the moral of american people at the duration of second world war it shows with the better way that the cinema can constitute body of propaganda the value of this film is only collection and no artistic in a film of propaganda it is useless to judge direction and actors watch that movie if you are interested to learn how propaganda functions in the movies or if you are a big fun of robert mitchum who has a small role in the film if you want to see a film for the second world war they exist much better and objective i rated it 	NEG
the first episode of this new show was on today and it was horrible not only did shaggy have a squeaky new voice that made listening to his lines torture but it s so far away from the original concept and animation style that it s barely recognizable as a scooby-doo show even back in the dark days when fred and velma were gone and scooby s nephew scrappy was there the team still solved mysteries this new show instead features shaggy and scooby battling a james bond type super-villain and his henchmen while living in a mansion there s not even a van called the mystery machine and the teaser for the next episode which promised a transformers type robot car did not put my mind at ease how can anyone take scooby doo and make this the show earns two point for two scenes featuring the whole scooby doo gang all of whom speak with the correct voices except shaggy and even then i m being far too generous 	NEG
oh my goodness this was a real big mess that just couldn t help itself jeffrey jon heder is a year old man still living with his mum diane keaton and not planning on going anywhere until his mother meets a rich businessman named mert jeff daniels who she may be getting married to it would have been an ok movie if heder didn t play his jeffrey so annoying from the very start there is no chance of liking him and it only gets worse and worse in the end we are supposed to like him but there was no reason to as he hadn t changed from the selfish brute that he was at the beginning of the movie keaton doesn t look to even be trying and is in horrible form after s because i said so not to mention the shocking chemistry between heder and keaton and where supposed to believe that their mother and son the only saving grace is jeff daniels and anna faris although they don t look very interested either apart from a few little smiles this film really doesn t deserve to be called a comedy simply because there is barely anything to laugh at if your in the mood for a recent diane keaton flick watch mad money or smother which are a lot better than this abysmal effort 	NEG
i vowed a long time ago to never ever watch a movie that has anyone who ever was a regular cast member of saturday night live i didn t rent corky romano but i was forced by my unfailing good manners to watch it for half an hour then my good manners failed stupid not funny tedious not hilarious bad not good that in a nutshell is all i can say for this video 	NEG
this has to be one of the worst movies of all time the graphics were horrendous the acting was b-movie and the effects were just plain nintendo qualified you would think that they would put a little more effort into it of course it is a scifi channel movie so you have to expect it to be low rate but this one takes the cake hell i m still laughing so as a shake-your-head in disbelief movie this one does well although it appears to have some known actors and actresses in this it is difficult for me to believe that they did not realize that the quality of this movie was worth their time and effort the graphics might have been good in the s or even early s but come on this is i wont give spoilers out let s just say that if you have played jurassic park on the nintendo you will be very familiar with what you see in this filmit is definitely not worth the hours it took to sit through the thing	NEG
audrey i know you truly cherish your husband ted s memory but please do his legacy justice and heed his wishes dr seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason we beg of you to please stop cashing in on his stories images fantasies and characters they are getting disemboweled by the powers that be of hollywood and broadway the children of tomorrow will be stuck with these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will forever pollute the loving warmth and innocence of his books it is indeed your property to do with as you wish i just wish you would listen to the advice of others for a little while save what is left of dr seuss thank you 	NEG
the book is so good that at least the opening of this made-for-tv movie will move you but then as it diverges more and more from the book taking out all the religion and love and mathematics and putting in cotton candy cliches it becomes boring still from comments i ve heard people who have not read the book tend to like it and if it leads even on child to read a wrinkle in time it will have served its purpose the most embarrassing change is to make the happy medium a clone of mary poppins uncle albert i love to laugh nothing is quite so squirm inducing as characters on the screen laughing hilariously at things that are totally unfunny 	NEG
i was one of those few americans that grew up with all of gerry andersen s marvelous creations thunderbirds was a great series for the time and would have made a great action adventure movie if only the writers could have figured out where to target it i expected it to be a romp but i did not expect it to aim at such a low age group like lost in space this could have been both visually stunning and exciting it should have focused on more action adventure and the goal of the original series saving people in trouble instead it focused on alan saving the day instead of his brothers who were cast too young anyway vs the original the breakout part was lady penelope and parker i didn t care too much for the characters in the original but i was grateful for them in the movie they stole the show i always enjoyed thunderbirds more for the high-tech than the stories and even that did not get enough screen time as far as i was concerned i would have enjoyed seeing more of the cool gadgets but then i m just a big kid ; 	NEG
after reading the reviews it became obvious that everyone intellectualized this work how utterly boring oh how about the good ol days and there was nothing like it of all the comments no one expressed any emotion to this work or any other i grew up just after the end of the steam age and this cinematic gem along with dan l boone graced the saturday afternoon matinées this was an annual movie that made the rounds and filled the seats with gabbing yapping farting giggling snot monsters like myself or was-self and it was a movie theatre filler at the time almost as big as the wizard of oz imdb insists that every critique contains something about the plot problem is was that it was rather a template here goes randolph scott cowboy hero gathers friends and goes defeats those evil people hooray all of us kids figured out that plot before we plunked our quarter down to watch it that was just about the plot line of every scott john wayne roy rogers film ever made if you take the time to go back and review each and every movie - just don t ask for surprises one must remember the context of the times there was no or little tv none for kids there was school there was the great outdoors there were toy guns no cyber time and the steam age had just collapsed but movies such as this provided the entertainment and filled the imaginations of young whippersnappers even the girls got into it this movie was the entertainment and it is just as mindless as anything produced today it had a purpose originally of being propaganda but quickly came to be kids movies our fathers had experienced the real thing and it wouldn t be until sam peckinpah a decade later who finally lavished the red splashes of imitation blood in realistic and copious quantities not until his directorship did anyone die slowly with great pain and miserably until peckinpah war and gun fights were a rather bloodless affair thanks sam to see a movie had little or no blood the adults didn t mind they wouldn t have tolerated it i think no guts spraying the shattering plant life so this movie had all of the glory and none of the gory gung ho was suitable for kids then you will see that i assigned a four to this rating why would i do that well it is a terrible movie no matter how i love it i do love this movie because it brought back one of the happier moments of my childhood but it is not all that good of a movie in quality terms basically gung ho transitted to become a romance novel for children should people watch it of course i am not saying to stay away realistically however the plot is simple the characters shallow they are shoals you can love a bad movie 	NEG
at one point violet lucy liu tells neil cillian murphy that why she constantly seeks out for an adventure she said because i m bore-phobic it mean that she can t really get on with her life by doing some mandatory activities well i think her reason and the way this film go is very ironic because watching the detectives is a cheer boredom have any of these characters actually doing something exciting for once neil is a geek who runs his own very small video rental shop he and his other geek friends usually hang out around the shop and watching movies together while debating about them afterward but neil s life is completely turned around when violet walks into his store she s an eccentric woman who hides a little secret from him anyway after some dates they decide to see each other the problem is violet is a person who keep doing prank jokes on neil and can t really doing something normal whereas neil is completely opposite to hers the question is is they are going to be in love at the end you bet watching the detectives is a cliché romantic-comedy to its core and they made it even worst by pretending to be something else from the first couple of set-up we know that neil is pretty laid-back guy who didn t really commit to anything and then violet enters the scene looking all weird and annoying so at this point we all know that we re going to sit though all meaningless situations to find out how they re going to end up in the end is it worth waiting for i would say no as i said they tried to give something more for the audience watching the detectives is trying to talk about commitment to observe how far people go to reach for something they desire we knew in the end that insane things that violet has done is all the test how far neil is ready to go to win her heart or whatever well i think it is completely bullshit this movie will end pretty quick if neil just said to himself forget about it that girl is one of a nutjob after collaborating with many great directors recently danny boyle s sunshine and days later ken loach s the wind that shakes the barley and neil jordan s breakfast on pluto to name a few it s pretty weird choice for cillian murphy to make a movie with one of broken lizard comedy troop paul soter by all means he s not bad as usual but such a talent actor like him shouldn t be wasting his time in the movie like this on the other hand lucy liu is dreadfully awful as violet her acting is a mess i mean it s all over the place and so over-the-top tony montana would have been proud the last but not least mistake that movie made is a completely irrelevant title you simply can t really connect a dot between the plot and its title; and then you will end up thinking that it makes no sense at all in short watching the detectives is pleasant if forgettable motion picture that you might have a chance to catch it on cable tv so quick that you couldn t imagine bloodymonday rating: 	NEG
around the late s animator don bluth frustrated with the output his company disney was churning defected from the mouse house to form his own studio his first production the secret of nimh was a brilliant feature that still holds up well to this day this was followed by an american tail and the land before time both of which were made under the involvement of steven spielberg and were commercially successful although none of those two films had the dark adult appeal of nimh they still are very charming enjoyable features for both children and grown-ups but before long don bluth had his first major misfire with all dogs go to heaven; critics were especially harsh on this film and matters weren t helped by the fact that it opened alongside disney s the little mermaid considering that the movie has such a friendly-sounding title one would expect all dogs go to heaven to be pleasant family fare instead bluth provides a surprisingly dark story involving gambling deceit crime mistreatment and murder that itself is not a problem for an animated feature per say but it does call into question over whether the film is for children on the other hand it s hard to say whether adults will find much to enjoy in all dogs go to heaven in short it s a movie with a major identity crisis set in a dreary junkyard of new orleans the movie starts out when charlie b barkin a rough-and-tumble german shepherd is run over by a car courtesy of his former gambling casino partner a nasty cigar-puffing pitbull carface before you know it charlie finds himself in heaven albeit by default here a whippet angel annabelle tells him that all dogs go to heaven because unlike people dogs are usually loyal and kind this line represents the confused nature of the movie since the dogs in the movie the whippet aside are presented as anything but upon realizing that he s been murdered charlie steals his way back to earth and plots to get even with carface with the reluctant help of his dachshund pal itchy charlie rescues carface s prize annemarie a human girl who can talk to animals in order to predict who will win the rat races charlie claims that he will help the little cutie find her a family but in reality he is using her skills to win fortunes at the race so that he can build a more elaborate casino of his own to bring carface down although he refuses to admit it charlie does grow to love annemarie the concept of the story isn t as problematic as the execution aside from the human girl annemarie and a flamboyant musical alligator who appears about three-quarters through with the vocal pipes of ken page none of the other characters emerge as likable nor frankly are even worth caring about unfortunately that also applies to charlie; in trying to make him an anti-hero the script composed by more than ten writers only succeeds in rendering the character too unlovable as such the audience feels no empathy for charlie and worse his redemption at the end of the movie does not come across as convincing further damaging to the character is the disappointingly uncharismatic vocal performance from burt reynolds besides the lack of an endearing lead the movie s other problem is in the structure of the story the slowly-paced plot jumps all over the place and makes a habit of throwing in extra scenes which serve no purpose but to pad out the movie s running time the aforementioned musical alligator who resides in a danky sewer infested with native rats seems to have been thrown in from nowhere as does a scene where charlie tries to show his generosity to annemarie by feeding a pack of pastel-colored pups pizza the whole screenplay feels like a rough first draft; a bit more polish could have made this a tighter impactful story matters are not helped by the lackluster musical numbers by charlie strouse and t j kuenster annemarie s song and the gator s ballad are the only good ones; the latter in particular benefits from ken page s mellifluous vocal or the uneven voice cast as mentioned burt reynolds stiff and lifeless charlie detracts from his already unlikeable character even further the only exception is a fiery confession to itchy about his true intentions toward the end dom deluise as itchy is pretty good but he s had better roles notably tiger in an american tail and jeremy in the secret of nimh ken page as mentioned is awesome in anything he does but his character has such a small part that his overall contribution is unremarkable at best similarly wasted are loni anderson as a collie who once sired a litter with charlie melba moore and charles nelson reilly judith barsi as annemarie is probably the only voice that comes across as truly memorable partially because her character is the sole legitimately likable one in this depressing and joyless show barsi aside the only real positive about all dogs go to heaven is the animation technically this film has some of the most imaginative visuals from bluth s team by s standards that is particularly a frightening scene where charlie has a nightmare about ending up in a fiery underworld ruled by a gargantuan satanic canine-demon if anything the movie is more of a triumph of animation than storytelling on the whole however i cannot recommend all dogs go to heaven as good entertainment even though i recognize that the movie has its fans and the climax does admittingly provide some energy and a moving conclusion the overall package is not in the same league as bluth s better efforts animation buffs will marvel at the lush artistry but by the time it s over all dogs go to heaven could very well leave a bad taste in your mouth 	NEG
a different look at horror the styling differences between american and russian films is interesting however from my american perspective this movie just wasn t that good the protagonist marie played by anastasia hille wasn t a pleasant character and i had a hard time identifying with her she was disagreeable most of the time and confused for much of what little time was left also too much time was spent in bringing her to the main location of the film then a long time passed before any real suspense built up once that happened it seemed volume was used as the main effect which was more annoying than anything else the concept was more original than most direct-to-video movies and they didn t use sex to make up for a thin plot all in all i d recommend it for renting but not for theater goers 	NEG
first of all the actor they have to play jesus has blue eyes half the actors they have playing jews have blue eyes aren t there enough brown-eyed actors out there jesus being depicted as having blue eyes is one of my pet peeves he was a full-blooded jew second of all what is it with old english-language movies that are supposed to take place in non-english-speaking countries and everybody has english accents another example is david lean s dr zhivago aren t there enough either jewish actors or actors who can do a israeli accent the movie often is not true to the scriptures and so seems to doubt the legitimacy of jesus s claim to be the messiah in the bible when jesus is baptized by john a voice comes from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased matthew : mark : luke : in the movie john the baptist says this the screenwriter seems to be trying to portray the believers as crazy as well for example in the bible the angel gabriel tells mary she will become pregnant with the son of god luke : - but in the movie we do not see or hear any angel - mary appears to be talking to a moonbeam and when mary s mother hears her talking to someone and peeks in on her she doesn t hear or see anyone either also in the movie when jesus is speaking to the pharisees in the temple in jerusalem he says you shall not see me here again not until you learn to cry blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord for i and my father are one and the same the correct line matthew : and luke : is you will not see me again until you say blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord period jesus never claimed to be god the movie cuts out a lot of important parts the sermon on the mount is very expurgated but then spends a lot of time on stuff that isn t even in the bible a whole scene with mary magdalene talking with a john it seems like the screenwriter instead of wanting to do a movie version of the scriptures wanted to make a movie about what he thinks might have really happened behind and between the scenes the movie has one gem though - during the scene where jesus tells the parable of the prodigal son at matthew the tax collector s house i had tears streaming down my face it is the best movie i ve seen about jesus s ministry but that isn t saying much because the others are just terrible jesus christ superstar is my favourite movie about jesus s last days the passion of the christ is way too graphic though i like how jesus of nazareth instead of just ending with jesus s death continues on and shows his resurrection 	NEG
there are people out there who will greenlight anything that is the only explanation i can offer as to why the house of the dead movie exists and that s only scary part to the whole movie it s so bad you ll go off movies forever i seriously wanted to switch this off and turn the tv over to the paint drying channel but i was bound by my word to suffer the whole thing i don t know why i do these bad things to myself as if it matters here s the basic jist of the story a group of twenty-somethings are so desperate to go out to some island in the pacific northwest canada actually because it s cheap for the rave of the century which consists of about people and un-raving music that they pay some craggy old fisherman $ to take them there after they miss the main ferry that s gotta be some rave to be worth all that dough the fisherman warns them that the island is also known as the island of the dead hang on-i thought this was house of the dead and that they are all doomed yadda yadda yadda first faults here why would a tiny little rave of the century my foot be held on some remote island why would anyone willingly pay loads of money to get it why pay even more to the craggy old fisherman to take them back when they could just come back with the others once they arrive they discover that the rave which consists of about tents a small stage and a port-a-john has been smashed there s blood everywhere and no one is around what would any rationally thinking person do run for their lives of course but no these clueless obviously blind people decide to go look for them soon enough they discover an old ramshackle house that s times as big on the inside as it is on the outside another half hour of stumbling around in the forest follows as an excuse to kill of some of the lesser characters and after much tedium they arrive back at the house again the characters like the movie go nowhere jammed into this ghastly disaster is a superabundance of gibberish dialogue heinous acting mumbo-jumbo exposition and zillions of clips from the once-popular arcade game of the same name why this was universally accepted as a good idea with the filmmakers i ll never know the clips have no reference to any of the scenes and only degrade this trash even further if that is at all possible it has nothing to do with the game save for some cheap throwaway line at the end it makes resident evil look like cinematic glory hell even the double dragon movie seems multi-oscar worthy in comparison to this junk the only one who comes out of this with his dignity still intact is jurgen prochnow he could have just taken his money and ran but he tries his best with the awful script and brings a tiny bit of pathos to his character the rest of the cast suck i m afraid the characters are idiots and deserve to die plus if you cut out the swearing and pointless nudity i see no reason why this film cannot be shown on saturday morning tv it s not frightening in the slightest pirates of the caribbean is more scary than the skeletal bad guys in this film and where did all those bad guys come from anyway there were only a few people on the island to begin with i guess this justifies the reason they chose to reuse footage over and over i kid you not you ll see the same zombie die a dozen times who s ultimately to blame for that scandalous waste of celluloid none other than director uwe boll his control over the movie is non-existent you can clearly the see actors have no idea what they should be doing and that the zombies aren t really taking it all seriously the actors seem like they re reading off cue cards as they constantly pause in the middle of long sentences and carry on talking as soon as they see the next card it all feels very unnatural plus the film is shot like a two-part mini-series i have indeed seen better tv productions and don t get me started on the editing the film is an incoherent babble with thousands upon thousands of pointless shots and dozens of meaningless camera pans no real skill or talent was put into making this at all it truly baffles and boggles the mind how movies this unfathomably bad can get made and george a romero can t even get anyone to take his calls house of the dead makes some idiotic reference to romero in a lazy attempt to be post-modern but it only irritates that they think this is in the same league as a real zombie movie for what it s worth the : anamorphic picture looks great and the dolby soundtrack is clean but very unimpressive and only serves to pronounce the heavily over-used adr even more the dvd comes with extras but why torture yourself isn t this review warning enough stay away you are all doomed i tell you doomed doomed 	NEG
i don t know who wrote the script for this movie but from the first moment on i was irritated of all possible decisions they could make up in the mountains why do they make the decision which is the most dangerous of all why do the criminals act dumb although they managed to get a huge amount of money out of a bank and get away with it why doesn t the main criminal land the helicopter shoot stallone grab the money and fly away with the chick as a hostage and there are more cases of illogical behavior i d give this movie points for nice action and great landscape scenery but due to the illogical behavior of the characters i just can give this movie point 	NEG
on steve irwin s show he s hillarious he doesn t even try to be funny and he just is but his movie wasn t even what i would call a movie-i mean when that guy on his car is trying to kill him he s just saying oh this is one nasty bloke and looking straight into the camera he put his face in the camera too much and then when the guy falls off the car wouldn t you expect him to be dead and terri had the worst acting i d ever seen like when the crocodile almost ate steve she just says steve she didn t sound scared or anything it was just steve i mean i hate to sound mean but that was not worth seeing i love steve irwin but his movie was just too stupid 	NEG

we expected something great when we went to see this bomb it is basically a broadway play put on film the music is plain terrible there isn t one memorable song in the movie -- heard any hits from this movie you won t because there aren t any some of the musical numbers go on so long that i got up to go to the restroom and get some pop corn and it was still going when i got back if they were good songs well -- but they suck the pace is slow terrible character development the lead was praised for her singing but sounded like she screamed every song -- it was almost impossible to stand this movie has nothing to offer anyone but die-hard broadway enthusiasts this is without a doubt the most over rated movie i ve seen in my entire life a complete waist of time and money there is nothing memorable about this movie except danny glover -- who wasn t on screen enough and whose character wasn t developed enough rent the video and you ll agree -- this movie was an expensive over produced polished dog do 	NEG
adapting plays into cinema is often a bad idea because they re two different mediums do you think it s a great idea to make zulu into a stage play imagine it where two valiant redcoats sit in a tent gasping blimey there s thousands of them out there great movie and a bad stage play in order for a stage play to make great cinema there s two essentials needed a fine cast that creates on screen chemistry great dialogue on paper cher and chazz palminterri would be a good casting choice but not in these roles the story revolves around a hit-man played by palminterri breaking into a house to kill a wife played by cher with most of the action taking place inside the house i was unable to take these two characters seriously though perhaps it was the fault of the script which can t decide whether it was trying to be serious or funny since the story is very static it s of the utmost importance that the dialogue shines and once again because of the bizarre tone of the screenplay it embarrasses more than anything else with much of the conversation revolving around sex acts if you want to see a great translation of a stage play transferred to the silver screen give faithful a miss and watch angry men instead	NEG
in the days before gore and sex took over real horror films were made castle of blood is in my estimation one of the finest although other reviewers have given it mixed ratings in an odd sort of way it reminds of the more recent the others which was in the theaters a couple of years ago director antonio margheriti remade his own picture in titling it this time web of the spider aka nella stretta morsa del ragno why he did this i do not understand although the remake starred anthony franciosa and klaus kinski and was very good in its own right perhaps he saw a good story and wished to tailor it more to american audiences i do not really know it is interesting that he did the original in black and white and the remake in color castle of blood is excellent italian gothic la danza macabra is said to be an unpublished work of edgar allen poe who appears in this film poe and lord blackwood owner of a haunted castle bet american writer alan foster george riviere that he cannot spend all souls night in said castle and survive foster eagerly accepts the bet but soon regrets it for he is witness to a series of murders committed by ghosts it seems that the ghosts come back to life once every few years but are doomed to re-enact the crimes they committed in life lord blackwood conveniently forgot to tell foster that his blood is needed for them to resurrect themselves on the next all souls night it does not take foster and the beautiful elisabeth blackwood portrayed by the incomparable barbara steele long to fall in love even though their romance is doomed because elisabeth is one of the ghosts i will not give the ending away but will just say that castle of blood is every bit a romantic tragedy as it is a horror story comments this film is greatly atmospheric even by the excellent standards of the italians my personal opinion is they do true horror better than anybody and the somewhat dim black and white filming only enhances this in fairness web of the spider was fine in its own right even with color and greater brightness i loved the lingering shots something most modern day directors do not have the patience for indeed when alan first enters the doomed castle we are treated to several minutes of him doing nothing but roaming around from room to room the dread ands unease building in his face and mannerisms by the time the first ghost appears the audience is thoroughly primed and ready there is wonderful dialogue between alan and the ghosts something else not often done in standard ghost stories there are also memorable scenes very visual for this type of film elisabeth s murder and the dance scene reminds somewhat of the similar dance of the ghouls in s carnival of souls were particularly good sadly few general interest viewers will ever hear of much less see this film that is a shame for this one is a cut above the rest i got my copy from sinister cinema and am not certain if it can be purchased anywhere else for persons interested in this genre it is a must see 	NEG
the original is a relaxing watch with some truly memorable animated sequences unfortunately the sequel while not the worst of the dtv sequels completely lacks the sparkle the biggest letdown is a lack of a story like belle s magical world the characters are told through a series of vignettes magical world while marginally better still manages to make a mess of the story in between the vignettes we see the mice at work and i personally think the antics of jaq and gus are the redeeming merits of this movie the first vignette is the best about cinderella getting used to being to being a princess this is the best because the mice were at their funniest here the worst of the vignettes when jaq turns into a human is cute at times but has a lack of imagination the last vignette when anastasia falls in love was also cute the problem was i couldn t imagine anastasia being friendly with cinderella as i considered her the meaner out of the stepsisters this was also marred by a rather ridiculous subplot about lucifer falling in love with pompom the incidental music was very pleasant to listen to;however i hated the songs they were really uninspired and nothing like the beautiful tchaikovsky inspired melodies of the original the characters were the strongest development here cinderella while still caring had lost her sincerity and a lot of her charm from the original though she does wear some very pretty clothes the duke had some truly funny moments but they weren t enough to save the film likewise with prudence and the king as i mentioned the mice were the redeeming merits of the movie as they alone contributed to the film s cuteness i have to say also the animation is colourful and above average and the voice acting was surprisingly good all in all a cute if unoriginal sequel that was marred by the songs and a lack of a story for the mice the voice acting the animation and some pretty dresses bethany cox	NEG
 or more precisely so bad that you are going to have the time of your life laughing your ass off when you watch it james sbardellati s deathstalker of is certainly one of the most awful productions the sword & sorcery sub-genre has brought along but it is highly amusing the acting is terrible the plot is pure crap and the effects and photography couldn t be more amateurish but it is the bad acting the cheesy effects and the many errors that makes this movie so hilarious - spoilers ahead -deathstalker rick hill is an extremely strong and skilled warrior one day a good witch tasks him to unite the three powers of chaos and creation a sword an amulet and a chalice in order to free the country from its brutal ruler the evil king and sorcerer munkar obtaining the sword is quite easy but the amulet and the chalice are in munkar s possession fortunately the evil king has arranged a tournament in which the county s most skilled warriors fight each other until death the winner is then to take the king s place of course the king doesn t want anybody to take his place an therefore he has planned to kill the winner instead of just not arranging the tournament in the first place deathstalker is not only to obtain the the three powers of creation but also to save the old good king s gorgeous daughter barbi benton from the claws of evil munkar luckily he doesn t get bored on his way to the tournament since he is allowed hump the gorgeous female warrior kaira lana clarkson in the meantime the film has many great incredibly stupid and funny scenes some of my favorite scenes include: - deathstalker beheads a bad guy with his sword the head that falls down however is not that guy s head the falling head has a red goatee while the guy beheaded by deathstalker had dark hair and no beard - when the character of female warrior kaira lana clarkson is introduced she is first seen in a black robe hiding her face and body deathstalker s traveling companion oghris richard brooker fights her and during the sword fight her robe under which she is of course topless opens exposing her breasts her breasts are the first thing we see of lana clarkson even before her face - the last warrior deathstalker has to fight in the tournament is a giant guy with the body of a man and the head of a pig - evil munkar has an ugly little creature locked in a chest he feeds that little creature human eyeballs and fingers there are many other unintentionally funny hilarious and great scenes the acting is terrible but barbi benton and the late lana clarkson are eye-candy and although i described this movie as unintentionally funny i sometimes had the impression that some of the actors were absolutely aware of how crappy the movie is there is a fair amount of gore and lots of female nudity to keep the viewer entertained deathstalker is an incredibly awful movie but i still highly recommend it people with a sense of humor will have the time of their lives 	NEG
watching it lives by night makes you wonder just who in the world greenlit this crap a newlywed couple go spelunking on their honeymoon get attacked by bats and the husband starts to run around in his pajamas attacking various people and where exactly are they they re in the desert then they re skiing then they re in a small town that looks like it has mountains nearby the town is run by a sheriff who likes to watch and has a personal vendetta against whiny doctor boy the ski hospital is run by a really groovy guy with a nice thick mustache and the wife looks like mary tyler moore or marilyn quayle there s no dramatic tension and the ending will leave you filled with anger special effects and makeup guru stan winston did the effects for this movie i guess you have to start somewhere 	NEG
i never saw the original version with judy garland so have no means of comparison also it s been some years but i found this tale neither gripping nor its romance captivating the movie tells the story of two lovers whose musical careers are headed in opposite directions john norman howard is a worn out disillusioned rock star on the decline embarking upon a romance with a fresh talented new singing sensation esther hoffman her dramatic success only serves to emphasize his decline the lead actors kris kristofferson and barbra streisand are adequate in their roles but neither their chemistry nor the plot left much of a mark with me the film is noteworthy to me for only one aspect streisand s beautiful rendition of the oscar winning song evergreen she truly has a powerful and magnificent voice 	NEG
i do have the `guts to inform you to please stay away from `dahmer the biographical film based on the real-life story of the grotesque serial killer `dahmer strays more in relation to the mentality of its focused subject jeffrey dahmer who murdered over young males and ate some of their body parts was probably the most incongruous serial killer of our generation however the real sick individuals are the filmmakers of this awful spectacle who should have had their heads examined before deciding to greenlight this awful `dahm project this is not an easy film to digest even though jeffrey would have easily digested it with some fiery `brainsadillas appetizers or even some real-life `mr potato skins failure	NEG
when the folks at kino video assembled their fine slapstick encyclopedia collection a multi-cassette selection of silent comedies someone decided to kick off the first installment with one too many an obscure one-reel farce made in florida starring the very young oliver hardy as enjoyable as the set is over all this decision was an unfortunate one for one too many is a very poor film which almost discourages the viewer from watching further like any typical farce this one involves deception inspired by greed panic when plans go awry and complications escalating to the point of absurdity but unlike the good ones one too many is incoherent unfunny and downright annoying it s hard to tell at this point whether the hopelessly confusing plot is the result of missing footage or inept film-making but whatever the cause by the halfway point even the most alert viewer has no idea what the character relationships are or what is happening and by the end one no longer cares the only point of interest here is seeing the year-old babe hardy who appears considerably heavier than he would a decade later when he teamed with stan laurel but who is nonetheless full of youthful energy in the opening scene awakening with a hangover babe performs a highly athletic backward roll off a bed trust me that s as funny as this movie gets if you read this before seeing the first cassette of kino s slapstick encyclopedia i suggest you fast-forward past this one and skip to the good stuff 	NEG
i read the half dozen other user comments on this board and it seems as though the opinions vary greatly i have to agree with those who found this movie to be awful it pains me to write that since i would have hoped this would have been great or i wouldn t have bothered to see it the other day i like supporting indie cinema especially if they are gay-themed but this movie is almost too much to tolerate those that walked out as i considered doing after about three minutes probably didn t mind shelling out $ or just figured it was going nowhere fast and not going to improve maybe i am slightly more optimistic than they are either that or they didn t pay to get in in the first place logan is bored he s a klutz he s gay i m okay with that the problem is that because the main character in a movie is bored does not necessarily mean that the movie about him has to be boring also there are endless scenes of this kid just laying around like a load of laundry re-establishing everything that you already learned in the first scene and the second scene etc etc nothing or no one goes anywhere no one says anything even remotely insightful or funny or interesting probably most appalling of all is that i didn t feel the slightest bit of empathy for logan that in itself is a major accomplishment he didn t grow he didn t change he didn t learn there is no one to teach him anything he didn t do anything and neither did the movie scene after scene of the same thing do not a movie make additionally the title makes no sense at all 	NEG
seriously i mean very seriously when i first started watching the show i thought it was good but the plots just got worse the storyline were either too boring or predictable george isn t always funny he sometimes acts stupid his jokes are overdone his mom is the silliest character of the show how can a mother treat her own son that way okay if it was the daughter in law but this was her own son i give this show a just because the first few shows were a little funny the actors constance marie and masiela lusha do a great job don t know how these shows get to play for so long if you re really bored like i was and have nothing else to watch i d suggest you watch this 	NEG
since its release in a christmas story the jean shepherd-narrated story of his alter-ego ralphie has become a true classic my summer story however still has shepherd as the narrator but it has absolutely none of the charm and the characters are nowhere near the caliber of the original film my summer story is basically a mishmash of mediocre and just plain not very interesting stories which include hillbilly neighbors and battling tops charles grodin who i normally like is extremely unlikeable in the role of the father more aptly handled by darren mcgavin in the original and his character never seems anything but forced kiernan culkin is a poor substitute for ralphie and the little brother is all but forgotten here only mom seems to have any worth here and perhaps that s because she beans a cinema manager with a gravy boat when he pushes his luck too far with irate housewives on free dish night the stories in this are mostly inconsequential and stretched paper-thin may appeal to the extremely undemanding but as a sequel to a christmas story it s a very poor one and not worth most people s time out of 	NEG
the directors cut version which was the one i saw was very long for this type of movie almost two hours is way too long if you have the choice definitely go for the non-directors cut the main plot is almost not taken up at all the movie consists to the main part of several murder scenes which are connected but the feeling is that they re only shown in order to fill the movie with splatterish violence the connection is not revealed until the latter part and the lack of context bored me out long before i was there as a horror movie it doesn t work you never get the required feel for the characters due to mediocre acting and the general disposition character is presented minutes later character is dead this pictures strong side lies in the splatter part 	NEG
one of the requirements of science fiction at least before it starts to become satire is that it be somewhat plausible i would think that an anti-matter bomb would do considerably more damage than for what it was intended but i ll leave that to the physicists who might have seen solar crisis it is a crisis the earth is facing because solar flares are getting totally out of hand they re getting close to earth so much so that it s become unseasonably hot as if the entire earth were death valley the answer is an anti-matter bomb which a space ship will have to take to the sun and explode it there that will divert the flares off in say the direction of say mercury providing it s not in direct alignment with the earth who to deliver it but captain tim matheson and his crew that is if he can keep his mind on the business at hand and not on runaway son corin nemec taking care of the personal side of the family problems is admiral charlton heston matheson s father and nemec s grandfather there s a villain here too peter boyle who is the ceo of a multi-national corporation which in this crisis is trying to control the world s food supply for the survivors the idea he might not survive doesn t enter into his thinking he s doing his best to sabotage matheson s mission solar crisis seems like a bad mix of a space odyssey and voyage to the bottom of the sea boyle seems to be taking his cue from gene hackman as lex luthor in superman apparently he s the only one in the cast who realizes he s in a turkey and overacts accordingly the rest of the cast are stalwart true blue and dull except possibly desert rat jack palance who finds nemec and cares for him the key here is that the film was directed by that noted hollywood purveyor of flop films allen smithee the film gets as much as four stars for the cast involved and it was out in time for a thanksgiving carving 	NEG
spoilers throughout i had read the book st to die and wanted to see if the movie followed the book so i watched it for the most part it did there were some minor differences location of the last violent scene for instance but not many and for the most part the movie stayed true to the book more so then most movies this may have been a mistake-although the movie was perfectly cast-with pollen and bellows especially-i was not that impressed with the book or let me take that back i started off very impressed gradually became more disillusioned and by the end was left completely unsatisfied and felt almost gypped no difference with the movie here is why there is no payoff in the book or the movie rarely have i read a who done it thriller that has created such a letdown with it s final resolution and i had hoped the movie would vary a little the whole- he did it no she did it no they both did it -was not interesting not fascinating and more confusing annoying and depressing then anything else add to that that the love of lindsay s life dies at the end after her disease cleares and she cries at his grave and then cut to where she s contemplating suicide then all of a sudden she s in a fight for her life with the real villain who was cleared after being arrested but it turns out he and the wife were in it together hello this whole thing has now become general hospital instead of a good old fashioned thriller i felt cheated and ripped off by the book and watching the movie i must admit it held my attention nicely -the acting was very good for a tv movie was hoping it wouldn t follow the book which it wound up doing i still think the movie is watchable and for some reason does not leave as bad a taste in your mouth as the book or maybe it s just that i knew what would happen but i have to say the way this story unraveled was not well done at all 	NEG
after highlander which i am still in denial about i thought is was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry because it was so bad i was wrong i loved the original wargames however this movie is inaccurate with computer details and details about the original movie the original wargames at least had some hacks that worked whoever wrote this movie knew nothing about computers except how to use a word processor i doubt he or she even watched the original movie the acting isn t even convincing please save yourselves under no circumstances watch this movie i don t care if the channel is stuck on the tv and you can t turn the tv off this movie will ruin your life 	NEG

the story line has been rehashed a number of times; a breath of life in the retirement home several plays movies novels short stories poems and news articles have beat the subject to no end but it s still an excellent platform for character studies if gideon was crafted more enthusiastically it could be brilliant but the dialogue is painfully boring and the story is absolutely flooded with cliches even the subtitle and summary of gideon s simple wisdom almost made me laugh in its ineffectiveness mostly indifferent acting is the final straw for this weak film but the rest of it is bland enough to make the actors lack of focus almost irrelevant 	NEG
the only reason i am commenting is because i finally figured out why dr cox was bald although we probably all realized it at the same time this week dr cox is bald because they showed these episodes in a different order than they filmed them the latest episode when our favorite grumpy jesus-loving nurse roberts dies dr cox shaves his head the must have showed them out of order for some odd reason and forgot they slipped up the continuity for shame scrubs they ve made mistakes like this before i remember when elliot is trying to date scott foley and her hair is wet seconds before water hits her i try not to notice these things but my favorite show needs to step it up 	NEG
seriously the fact that this show is so popular just boggles the mind this show isn t funny it isn t clever it isn t original it s just a steaming pile of bull crap let me start with the characters the characters are all one-dimensional morons with loud exaggerated voices that just sound like fingernails on a blackboard the voice acting could ve been better then there s the animation my god it hurts my eyes just looking at it everything is too flat too pointy too bright and too candy coated then there s the humor or lack thereof it s completely idiotic they just take these b-grade jokes that aren t even that funny in the first place and then repeat them to death they also throw in some pointless potty humor which sickens me and finally last and least the music it s just plain annoying it sounds like it was composed on a child s computer and generates no emotion whatsoever i wish there was a score lower than i really do this show seriously needs to be canceled it s a show i try to avoid like the plague whenever i hear the theme song i immediately turn the tv off if you ve never watched this show then don t watch quality programming like the simpsons or futurama 	NEG
let me first state that i enjoy watching bad movies it s funny how some of these films leave more of a lasting impression than the truly superb ones this film is bad in a disturbingly malicious way this vehicle for sam mraovich s delusional ego doesn t just border on talentless ineptitude it has redefined the very meaning of the words this should forever be the barometer for bad movies sort of the mendoza line for film mr mraovich writes directs and stars as blunt object arthur sailes battling scorned wives and the christian forces of evil as he and his partner ben dead behind the eyes sheets struggle for marital equality as a libertarian i believe gays should have a right to get married ben & arthur do more harm to that cause than an army of homophobes the portrayal of all things christian are so ugly and ham-fisted trademark mraovich that you can t possibly take any of them seriously arthur s brother victor the bible toting jesus freak is so horribly over-the-top evil effeminately gay that you have to wonder how he was cast in this role that s because sam multitasking mraovich was also casting director the worst of it all is sam mraovich himself when you think leading man do the words pasty balding and chubby come to mind sam also delivers lines like domino s pizza cold and usually wrong the final tally: you suck at writing directing acting and casting that s the ed wood quadruple crown congratulations you horrible little man 	NEG
 - a visit to the lodz ghetto in nazi-occupied poland recorded by a german cameramen with the naive co-operation of the jewish community is combined with archival footage clips from international newsreels and excerpts from related cultural films to portray the world s jews as swindlers and parasites this documentary interprets jewish life from the viewpoint of traditional anti-semitism and nazi ideology a candid cinematically-unique expression of racial hatred i personally find this film frightening and highly offensive one can only hope that such pictures as this will never reach the screen again 	NEG
the germans all stand out in the open and get mowed down with a machine gun the good guys never die unless its for dramatic purposes the plot has so many holes its laughable where did the german soldiers go once they rolled the fuel tank towards the train erik estrada please and the whole idea hijacking a train how moronic is that the germans know where you are going to go its not like you can leave the track and drive away what a waste i would rather bonk myself on the head with a ball peen hammer times then have to sit through that again i mean seriously it felt like it was made in the s but it was produced in the a-team is more believable than this horrid excuse for a movie only watch it if you need a good laugh this movie is to tele sevalas what green beret was to john wayne 	NEG
few films have left me with such a feeling of unease and this is not a compliment since i saw it in a theater how it ended there i can only wonder i was subjected to mn of hateful derivative garbage the main impression being a bit like this other sick-o movie don t answer the phone - but worse the nastiness of it all rape and all is shown without any distance unlike strong stuff like last house on the left and utter contempt for the perfect victims and everybody involved leaving the viewer to be treated as a sadistic voyeur at the end i felt like taking a shower no credits to the director	NEG
i really wanted to like this movie it has a nice prison setting conspiracy theories bloodthirsty zombies a perfectly hideous s-touch and it is a directorial effort by actor john saxon who also plays a bad you guessed it a bad guy it reminds me of some beloved italian horror flicks but the direction is very wooden and there is no nightmarish frightening moment in there it just goes on and on and on and then it logically has to end more suspense and more daring visuals and its destiny as a cult classic would have been sealed 	NEG
star rating: saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning mcbain played by gary busey before the name became synonymous with the character in the simpsons is a typically unorthodox cop who gets results but winds his superiors up something rotten avoiding the cliché of his partner being killed at the beginning of the film the plot instead takes a different turn and sees him assigned to travel to mexico where a top secret american super tank with incredible firepower and imaging capabilities has been smuggled through only to be taken hostage along with the crew by a gang of terrorists this cheap looking even by s standards boring little action film was a bizarre career move for gary busey after making an impression as the flame haired villain mr joshua in lethal weapon he just goes through the motions with his cardboard character here edgy and zany as ever with butthorn being his trademark put down for the bad guys but without the material to back him up henry silva has presence as a screen villain but he s totally miscast here as an arab leader in a red beret and the awful script gives him some really clunky lines of dull dialogue that make his performance come off as laughably wooden he s just one of a host of action film character actors including l q jones and lincoln kilpatrick who pop up but fail to add anything to the mix after a dull first half without much exciting action things do pick up a bit at the end but it s too little too late and none of it manages the task of being any fun 	NEG
i guess this would be a great movie for a true believer in organized christian dogma but for anyone with an open mind who believes in free will rational thinking the separation of church & state and good science fiction it is a terrible joke there are some well known actors who were either badly in need of work or had a need to share their personal beliefs with the rest of us heathens i was entertained by this movie in the same way i was entertained by reefer madness that movie attempted to teach drug education by scare tactics the same way this movie tries to teach christian principles with the threat of hell and misery for otherwise good people who don t share their interpretations of our world it had me howling with laughter and at the same time scared me to realize how many people actually believe that our society should revert to the good old days of the th century 	NEG
i just got the uk -disc special edition of superman for about $ the additional stuff includes the feature superman and the mole-men so i slapped it into the dvd player last night and here are my findings some initial disappointment - i hadn t checked and i think i had it mentally tagged as one of the kirk alyn serials i m not a huge fan of george reeves as superman and i hadn t seen anything other than the odd clip of kirk alyn - but hey ho never mind this black and white production runs for less than an hour it has the feel of a couple of episodes of one of reeves early tv series a two-parter put together for cinema release although imdb says it was filmed as a cinema release in advance of the first tv series in any event it s an odd choice for reasons i ll get to later i m of an age where i recall tv and movie productions which are limited to one or two locations and sets so there were no major surprises here even so for a low budget movie this one is really low budget the story concerns the small town of silsby - population - which puzzlingly is also home to the world s deepest oil well miles the story opens with the well s foreman hurriedly taking steps to close the well down this conflicts with the arrival of metropolis reporters kent and lane to report on the well at the behest of the oil company as clark is sniffing out the fact that the drill has emerged into a radioactive cavern miles down a couple of odd little guys small in stature big in head black in jumpsuit and bushy in eyebrow emerge from the capped-off drillshaft and start mooching round town with puzzled expressions on their faces a deep breath now here is the remaining plot of the picture the little guys scare some kids so jeff corey playing the town s rampant xenophobe incites some pals to kill these creatures superman steps in moderately ineffectually and catches one of the little guys who has been shot and takes him to the local hospital corey s pals burn down the shack the other little fellow has hidden in and assume he is killed but he escapes and legs it down the shaft corey incites a lynch mob despite the sheriff arresting him to hang the hospitalised mole-man superman stops them entering the hospital and takes the injured chappie to the shaft to return him to his fellows a total of mole-men emerge with a weapon of some sort which they fire at jeff corey i call this an aargh gun because its sole effect seems to be to make corey go aargh and superman saves him he immediately changes his ways because of amazement at superman saving him after the way he has behaved the mole-men go back down the shaft the end despite the film only being an hour long there is an inordinate amount of creeping around bewareing and pursuing - i have left out all the mole-man creeps from a to b looking out to make sure no-one is following him stuff the mole-men are never engaged in any way whatsoever - they have no dialogue - they just turn up get persecuted and go back they do look a little creepy but they are hardly the bug-eyed monsters that the town s reaction implies reeves is quite a good clark kent - very much a hard-nosed reporter much more so than phyllis coates rather indifferent lois lane but he is a terrible terrible superman not only does he not look the part at least his hair is dyed black in this which is an improvement from the rather light hair he sported in some of the tv episodes the way he plays it is all wrong in my book i m sure he was told to strike the pose which superman does constantly but someone should have told him that it should be fists on hips not fists on ribs and he plays superman as a rather strict and touchy schoolteacher - he doesn t actually wag his finger in remonstration but he may as well have done and superman does a huge amount of walking around i say a huge amount - he isn t actually in it all that much and a bit of running he takes off and lands a couple of times but isn t seen in flight at any point oh some bullets bounce off him and he uses telescopic vision as clark but with no accompanying visual effect in fact visual effects are conspicuous by their absence and the few which are present aren t very good i ve tried to consider this effort by reference to the standards of the time: but even by those standards i think it s a pretty threadbare effort thankfully production standards on the tv series were higher and at least they took the trouble to come up with stories which had a bit more to them something of a disappointment - i shan t be watching it again 	NEG
a short review but avoid at all costs a thorough waste of mins at the end of the film i was none the wiser as to what had actually happened it s full of cameos stephen fry mins jack dee secs the philadelphia girls and some vaguely recognisable people but it just doesn t make any sense whether the story just got lost in the edit i don t now but jeez put on a dvd instead or go to bed and get some rest out of for the cameos and a morris minor car chase 	NEG
this was one of the worst movies ever it was so bad i was laughing through the whole movie the plot was so cheesy; especially the end this movie turns from an end-of-the-world-disaster to save-the-eels i mean c mon and i swear i think they use sock puppets for the eels and there was this horrible kiss scene in the middle with the two main characters who happened to be divorced how predictable it was so terrible that my mom my sister and i couldn t finish it and when we did finish it it was about a year later the second time we watched it and we finished it this time we did mst k-like comments throughout the movie summary: only watch this if you re a movie basher make hilarious comments watch this at a sleepover for laughs and i mean huge laughs also watch for mockery the metaphor that explains this movie: this movie is a very shallow field full of cheese and sock puppets 	NEG
orca is not exactly bad but it s not really richard harris s finest hour either as a demented ahab-like fisherman harris gets into a game of death with a vengeful killer whale after killing the whale s wife and unborn child charlotte rampling plays a whale expert who gets involved with harris she yells at him a lot about how important it is to leave nature alone he doesn t listen and somehow ends up in the arctic battling the revenge crazed whale there are no special effects to speak of except for what looks like a round mirror for a whale s eye --- there are endless shots of harris reflected in the eye so the audience understands that the whale knows who he is bo derek as one of harris s crew has a particularly unpleasant run in with the orca and most of the supporting cast including robert carridine will sampson and keenan wynn don t fare very well either 	NEG
lame movie completely uninteresting no chemistry at all between indiana jones and the guy from black hawk down the car chase scene just goes on and on and on ad nauseum they manage to switch vehicles a few times but always end up right on the tail of the baddies the scene where hartnett grabs the family s car with the crying kids in the back was just as stupid as could be he is telling them about eastern philosophy and how it is all right to die which i imagine the writers thought was funny or even witty it just came off as moronic totally unbelievable and even cruel some subplots weren t even explored they were just used as filler why does hartnett get sick seeing dead bodies yet keeps ordering burgers at crime scenes why and on what grounds is the bad ia guy suddenly arrested out of the blue by the chief why can ia pick up the buddy cops and then just let them answer their phones or pretend to be indian mystics and then just let them waltz out of there without so much as a slap on the wrist for some reason even though ford is uncovered as a cheat and a fraud when acting as a realtor he makes up the prices when he is trying to sell the producer s house to jack up his own commission they keep coming back to him anyway they knew he lied to both of them yet there they were coming to terms that both said they would never go for stupid just stupid this is also one of those cop movies where they just fire wantonly on public streets with no care in the world for innocent bystanders there they were just standing on the sidewalk blasting away while people ducked for cover amazing that they didn t hit a single person after having fired about rounds each the scriptwriting was terrible the action sequences were boring the plot just a sidestory to a very pathetic attempt to have us root for ford and hartnett it fails miserably and ford s phone turn the damn thing off how many times could it ring in a -hour movie it was frustratingly aggravating by the midpoint in the movie every seconds that stupid tune would play and if it wasn t ford s then hartnett s was ringing it was incredibly annoying complete waste of time ford s worst movie since days nights which was without a doubt the lowest point of his distinguished career 	NEG
it a bit peculiar that a story that is placed in a part of oslo where a very high percentage of the local residents is from an asian background does not even show one asian or african person not even as an extra that fact probably describes norwegian race relations in general - however no spoilers - only a brief introductory description:buddy portrays four young people living in a flat-share in oslo the protagonist are two young men that don t manage to direct their life in any serious fashion and one might say that the film could be about being indecisive and avoiding responsibility - a sort of fear of growing up the narrative plays on typical teenage dreams and fantasies and lifestyle role models quite the cliché although the story is mildly funny the acting is good and as a young person one can sort of identify with the characters `crazy situations and complicated love affairs i don t find the story or the characters very believable to polished and lacking in depth this film uses all the classic audience pleasing tricks to make an entertaining film that has as much intellectual depth as `friends yes that show on tv has norwegian film finally found its identity : audience pleasers in well known american style how about watching lukas moodysson s tillsammans together 	NEG
a collection of deleted scenes and alternative takes edited together and with added voice-over to make it appear to take place after the events of the first pretty cool idea but deleted scenes are left on the cutting room floor for a reason and this is further proof as it s just not as funny as anchorman and really let s face it that film wasn t exactly comedy gold either so you get a movie worse than one that was moderately funny in my eyes that still puts it one or two notches above kicking and screaming or bewitched chross your fingers that the wedding crashers is a return to old school form no pun intended my grade: d	NEG
disappointing and irritating the screenwriter has no true understanding of human nature but instead strings together clichés in a disjointed fashion character is not explored in depth these are puppets plunked down in a plot he openly confesses needed a dramatic element the mother s affair with her daughter s lover anne reid gives an excellent performance in spite of being given some peculiar situations and lines such standing passively to allow her angry daughter to slug her in the eye the script portrays darren daniel craig as a dr jekyll mr hyde without any hints about why except that he snorts cocaine before the big scene a mature writer could have done so much more with this topic 	NEG
you d think the first landing on the moon would be dramatic enough without needing to make up stuff about it however this documentary seems to need to cast everything in the scariest possible light it talks about the risks associated with the lunar module and mentions armstrong s nearly fatal accident with the training vehicle as if the trainer and the spacecraft had anything to do with each other it makes the computer overload problem the and alarms encountered during the final landing sequence sound like a near-catastrophe when it was just an annoyance and not a risk to the crew at all and it takes the thirty seconds call to mean thirty seconds of fuel left before running out when it s actually thirty seconds before an abort is mandatory if you want to see a documentary or dramatization of apollo go for from the earth to the moon or one of the pbs documentaries but skip this one 	NEG
this is one of the worst films i ve ever seen i looked into it mainly out of a morbid curiosity since i loved the novel and i wish i hadn t i turned it off after a little less than an hour though i wanted to turn it off after five minutes i wish i had it disregards the novel a lot and changes all sorts of factors unless the film managed to redeem itself in the last or so minutes which would be impossible i would in no way recommend this its an insult to one of the greatest writers of the th century i don t think as many people say that it is that the bell jar is necessarily unfilmable but this particular rendition could have been done without i d almost like to see this one day in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can do it justice 	NEG
i just couldn t stop laughing this movie is incredibly funny and stupid but never mind that it is very entertaining in this film you don t need to pay attention to anything the acting is the same - lame the dinosaurs are the same - rubber oh my i could see the stick that holds t-rex head for a moment the raptors are the same from the carnosaur t-rex is also the same but in some scenes his head looks kinda stuffed and it looks like some kind of project failure from kindergarten action is fast sometimes too fast actually i talk about fast editing they edited it so fast so that we cannot see the rubber dinosaurs but oopps to late they are rubber well only things interesting here is to see rick dean in this sequel what can i say don t rent it watch it on tv with friends it is much more entertaining 	NEG
it s here finally a movie comes out that i can honestly say is worse than larry the cable guy: health inspector yet i m willing to bet the the wayan s brothers hilarious will make more money than i ever make in my whole life on what is sure to be one of the top five worst films of all time outside of my fifth grade outside the class re-enactment of romeo and juliet i mean really why would anyone ever ever see this movie unless they were paid to the comedy is weak and all even remotely funny jokes from the flimsy plot were surely revealed in commercials final word is this movie was a terrible letdown for me and the commercials looked so promising 	NEG
hopelessly inept and dull movie in which the characters stand around in rooms or a rocket ship and talk endlessly you might think things would perk up when they explore mars but these scenes are filmed through a heavy red orange filter which makes everything very murky the martian landscape vegetation consists mainly of drawings and the monsters are entirely unconvincing there are echoes of bride of the monster when the heroine carefully winds the octopus like tentacle of a flesh eating plant around her before weakly thrashing about the difference being that the ed wood film is a hundred times more entertaining better wear earplugs when watching otherwise the sci-fi music score repeated endlessly will drive you insane if you find yourself unable to sleep one night just slip this one into the vcr and your insomnia will be cured in no time 	NEG
i absolutely fail to see what is funny in this film the humor seems to be destined for corpses it s slow the story is too simple to be true the characters do not raise much sympathy a few non-important characters aside nothing surprising happens what did the writers of this script think oooo funny let s make some old lady s high on pot let s make them giggle let s make them behave like little children oooo yes that s absolutely brilliant and original this film has irritated me most from all the films i ve seen in the last five years 	NEG
i ve been watching a lot of cartoon or animated movies because i have a baby girl who likes to watch tv i began to watch this movie to see if i would like my little one to watch it and no at the beginning i thought it was such a cute movie like the bambi movie but all the way it was like insinuating the ducky was a homosexual the info said that they were making fun of him because he wasn t good at sports but that was not the case it just seems like a movie made for kids to learn to be okay being gay it was also very sad as far as the ducky s dad and all i don t know i guess if you re gay you d like it but i don t think i m going to watch it again with my little one 	NEG
any one who saw the original would have to go out and destroy this dreadful remake alex baldwin trying to imitate the late steve mcqueen in a word for word remake just doesn t work while baldwin has done some admirable work this is a flop from start to finish mcqueen had charisma never try to compete with a star as for kim in the role of ali mcgraw enough said mcqueen looked dangerous menacing and believable as doc the film had excitement and suspense baldwin and company made this into a comedy i laughed the one and only time i saw this miserable film and that dreadful hairstyle for michael madsen who is one of today s more exciting and believable actors did the makeup people have it in for michael what were they thinking if you wish to see movie-making the way it was under sam peckinpah s direction get the original 	NEG
from the star of mitchell from the director of joysticks and angel s revenge these are taglines that would normally keep me from seeing this movie and the worst part is that all the above mentioned statements are true ugghhh joe don baker eats every other five minutes in this film it s like a bad remake of coogan s bluff 	NEG
what an empty and lack lustre rendition of the classic novel i do wish people would stop messing about with classics when they clearly have no idea of the real intention or point of the original this version is no different i felt that the ralph fiennes version is much worse though as the casting of juliette brioche as kathy has got to be the worst casting decision ever anyway back to this version it aims to make the story relevant to a contemporary setting and in a musical style it succeeds in both but high art it is nit throwaway viewing for a rainy day maybe the direction was average and the editing abysmal worse than the old quincy deepak verma does a great turn as hindley and is in fact one of britains wasted talents the part of heath was played with great charm and belief and i think that the casting is the strongest point of this project although a more talented director would have made better use of the facilities he had its clear that he was a director for hire and didn t instill the project with the passion that it deserved 	NEG
split second might have been a good movie a story about a road rage homicide has a very young clive owen giving a pretty good performance; but but unfortunately the filmmakers undercut their own movie with idiotic camera-work and truly awful editing the camera jumps all over creation in an unsuccessful attempt i suppose to reflect owen s stress from business family and traffic what this actually does is to give the viewer a headache since the filmmakers cared nothing about making a good movie but only to impress each other with their idiotic photography one ought not waste time on this travesty 	NEG
wow what can i say first off imdb says this is in the late s which means carlito would be very close to going to prison he got out in and said he was in for years they used a bunch of nobody actors and a story that didn t even make sense they bring back only one actor guzman and hes playing a totally different guy why did it end with him and this puerto rican chick wheres gale he said he was in love with her before wheres kleinfeld he said he knew him forever you d think he d have been in this one and if this made sense where are rocco and the black dude in the first one it was all just stupid this is an insult to pacino and the first film 	NEG
how rick sloane was allowed to make five movies is harder to believe than cold fusion this film is absolutely criminal before watching this movie i thought manos: hands of fate was the worse piece of crap i ever saw but at least manos moves so slowly you might fall asleep thereby rescuing your eyes from the pain it will suffer the greatest tragedy of this movie is that the old man that keeps the hobgoblins locked up makes it to the final scene the time i spent watching this movie was an absolute waste of my life 	NEG
i used to have a fascination with the cartoon back in college when it was being made it had much the charm of get smart while it admittedly had its faults it was rather enjoyable naturally i was very interested in seeing the film version that was before i saw it afterwords i wished it had never been made besides being miscast all around who on earth though broderick was even close to the role it just didn t make the grade the effects were reasonable and perhaps the only thing i liked about the movie; seeing a live-action version of the gadgets in action what was missing was a story and treatment which made it funny or charming or interesting the original was a wacky cartoon with a very lighthearted attitude it was fun the motion picture became murky and took itself far too seriously if it had seriously had a great plot or went crazy enough to make it seem like a cartoon on film it might have been enjoyable as it exists it doesn t deserve to be considered part of the gadget legacy 	NEG
i blind bought this movie and am pretty upset that i paid as much as i did but i would say that it s at least worth a rent for some cool deaths and laughable acting it is not a good movie in any way but i must say that i was pretty darn entertained i guess it could be called so-bad-it s-good as i said the acting is awful i feel like i could have done a better job showing at least any emotion the story is nothing new and has been done better i guess i just have a soft spot for any carnival-esquire type film i would say rent this or download it but definitely don t buy it it is not worth more than one watch 	NEG
i started watching this movie expecting some barely tolerable hammer horror film wannabe and i wasn t far off there s a fair amount of glimpsed gore and they threw in lots of nudity but the latter half of the movie presents a few ironic twists holy cow they actually put a little thought into the story and didn t completely fall into the predictable stuff one expected at the outset and dare i say it some of the gratuitous nudity wasn t so gratuitous after all because it fit in with the story and setting don t get me wrong it s still overall a bad movie but as bad movies go it s a shade more intelligent than the really horrible tripe like mesa of lost women and robot monster 	NEG
i bought this dvd set sight unseen and wish i hadn t the script needed some serious rewriting as it seems to be completely devoid of any feeling and pales in comparison to the book the lighting is horrid very unpolished but if it was just that i could overlook it the script doesn t focus enough on the characters there is hardly an introduction to various characters making it a tad difficult to distinguish who is who especially in the planes--no idea who dies when i have long felt that the key to a good film is in getting the audience to care about the characters; if you don t have that you don t have anything there was no focus on the characters at all--you never got to know them--who they were what they liked what made them do the things that they do the series is hours long and split up into parts i bet you are wondering what they did with all this time if they didn t detail the characters---they put a lot of filler in it i will say at least an entire hour is spent watching them land and take off in their planes lol i mean do we really need to see that over and over again i would have given this a much higher rating had they just improved our knowledge of the characters 	NEG
truly awful film made by cinematographer-turned-director ted tetzlaff decent enough looking film but for a time-bomb movie totally devoid of any tension whatsoever ford as someone put it here sleepwalks though this one with his characteristic smirk there are some details thrown around- canadian ex-army or raf defused bombs in the war his wife is leaving him- but none of these back stories add up to much the bomber himself is a complete mystery why is he trying to blow up this shipment of mines for that matter what time period are we talking about here wwii or postwar i assumed the latter which makes bomber s motive even more salient generally though just a horrible film there are plenty of good time-bomb flicks to skip this one watch any episode of danger uxb for a more exciting time at about the same running time 	NEG
have i seen a worse movie perhaps only manos: the hands of fate dragged more than dukes i had more fun poking at the gigantic plot holes than the movie gave me at any point let s touch on a few there was a noticeable script death and rebirth when sheev is talking to the dukes and they don t respond he shrugs and moves on since neither the knoxville or scott know what he s talking about nor do we it was like the engine died and was restarted the few times the general lee flew through the air weren t even that exciting nothing i haven t seen on the tv series very little chemistry between knoxville and scott the best part was when bo is upset at luke for stealing the girl he liked the only reason this works is that the script actually forshadowed it although roughly the rest of the time it seems distant and forced seann william scott s awful horrendous accent or lack thereof i hated willie nelson s performance were bad jokes supposed to be endearing i wanted him to disappear jessica simpson comes across splendidly on the big screen she actually felt like one of the better actors in the film that s telling you how horrible this movie is she s a goddess during the climax of the film i was rooting for boss hogg and the bad guys to flatten all of hazzard county starting with willie nelson and his accomplices a nuclear bomb would have sufficed this is not meant to be a coherent dismantling of the film but a release of frustration at the abysmal writing and execution of what could have been a truly heartwarming film if only we could erase and start over 	NEG
for the record this film is intriguing but its hardly original back in a movie starring talia shire called the landlady had almost the exact same plot but with younger characters the story is amanda lear has had a bad life abusive father horny doctor mental homes etc she s finally released from the happy home under the guidance of her perverted doctor who she anally abuses and kills the poor guy now that was original the doctor had financed a mansion for her before she killed him and buried the sucker in the backyard after moving in she falls in love with a stud named richard who just happens to be married to a blues singer if you ve seen the landlady you know the rest she kills or tries to kill anyone that gets in between her and richard including a roadie much of the idea s came from the previous movie same idiot sidekick that sticks his nose in same spying on the guy with a bowl of popcorn same flying a bodypress it did have some original material the beer bottle thing was brutal the highlight of the movie was amanda s beautiful breasts in the hot-top scene somewhat of a ripoff but not a total waste of time out of 	NEG
a seemingly endless movie that really deserves a zero rating the premise seems simple enough: yentl a girl interested in studying the talmud wants to go to school but only boys are allowed to study so after her father s death she decides to disguise herself as a boy to get in she does and becomes close friends with avigdor who is to be married to a beautiful woman named hadass hadass family learns avigdor s brother committed suicide and the wedding is called off yentl now calling herself anschel is then selected to marry hadass she does but it is never consummated yentl anschel and avigdor go away for a few days and yentl anschel reveals her secret to him the movie ends with avigdor returning to and marrying hadass and yentl going to america to continue her studies although she will have to continue to do so in disguise the plot above seems interesting at first for a movie over hours long but there are several things that ruin it for starters there is the constant singing i can already hear the critics shouting yes i know this is a musical so there are supposed to be lots of songs and dance numbers but the movie could have been improved if it were directed and played without them the songs become tedious after a while and there isn t as much dancing as one would expect many of the songs are forgettable with no real memorable lyrics and those with any significance could easily have been substituted by a voice-over only one song stands out from the rest papa can you hear me it is obvious that most of the others were deliberately placed so streisand could simply have a reason to show off her vocal abilities every five to ten minutes chances are anyone who will see this film will already know what a superb singer and actress she is so the songs really aren t necessary second streisand s makeup which can be seen during her scenes as a man the lipstick enhanced lashes and traces of blush are all obvious makes it hard for the audience to believe in the yentl anschel character that she is actually serious and fooling her new friends colleagues and even hadass into believing she is a man yet we are asked and expected to believe that very thing there seems to be a contradiction as her character talks or rather sings of how she doesn t think she can pull it off but is surprised that everyone seems to be fooled because she is wearing men s clothing this means that we are then expected to believe the other characters are so naive they can t see the other differences such as her actions which are clear giveaways the facial differences alone cannot be included as other characters in the film mention that some of their male relatives or friends didn t have a beard or other facial hair nevertheless in the s if a woman dressed as a man but wore as much makeup as streisand s character did and still tried to pass herself off as a man solely because she wore men s clothing it would have been deemed unacceptable and caused an outrage chances are she would probably be forced to leave the town or even the country therefore the feminine makeup on streisand does not lend to the character s credibility and only weakens the plot if it was only applied to make streisand look more beautiful it should have been scrapped thirdly when yentl anschel herself reveals who she truly is toward the end we are then asked to believe that the other characters are not as smart as streisand s and only when they learn the truth do they become a little wiser by now it becomes more and more apparent that the whole plot is so far fetched that it is nothing more than a custom-made vehicle for streisand to fuel lastly there are those who are fans of streisand who will find no fault with this film its plot or the songs to those i must respectfully disagree while she has excellent vocal and acting abilities i am not a fan of her style of singing however i have enjoyed many of her other features including musicals there are even some songs of hers that i like so i am not a hater nor have set out to bash her i have written this review from an honest perspective from someone who has tried their best to watch this movie - several times even - and has noted the problems within if streisand was interested in creating a great or even believable film she could have done so here by not injecting her need to show off and prove how talented beautiful and smart she is at nearly every turn this movie does nothing more than hurt her abilities make her appear self-absorbed and thus turn the film into a laugh-fest unworthy of her fans or audience 	NEG
spoilers if such a thing is possible as a rabid robin williams fan i felt it necessary to buy this film as first on-screen appearance wow i could not imagine a more mind-numbing movie essentially the movie takes one bad joke after another that your uncle artie would tell you after dinner and dramatizes them robin williams plays a lawyer in a sec skit i m all for bawdy humor but this humor wasn t pleasantly vulgar or ribald it was just mind-numbing there are no redeeming qualities to this film other than robin williams fanatics like me who simply have to own every piece of film 	NEG

closer to reality and containing more depth than breakdance stan lathan s beat street is still a pretty dull show again this pic is really only cashing in on the breakin craze but at least we get a little bit of entertainment from the plot which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother all growing up in queens new york each has their own unique talent one is a hustler one a d j another an artist who creates burners while little bro lee is a hot hip hop dancer lathan is unable to generate any real audience interest in the story though and his young cast are likewise struggling with their characters therefore it is left almost entirely to the funky music and the fresh dancing to save the day choreography is again sharp for both club and street scenes but this alone is not enough to lift beat street to greater heights unfortunately the film really falls flat late on after showing a glimmer of hope that it just might get interesting sunday august - video	NEG
overall performance :- at last the long waiting aag hits the screens unfortunately it couldn t set progressive fire in the audience the first best thing to talk about the movie is the idea of remaking the mighty sholay and varma made a nice choice of changing the total backdrop of the movie if he repeated the same ramghad backdrop people will again say there is nothing new in this different background is appreciative but the way he presented it is not worthy right from the start of his career with siva in telugu he had been using the same lighting and kind of background i seriously dunno this guy varma considers about lighting or not or may be he has no other lighting technique other than like gordon willis godfather it s all dutch dutch dutch dutch why would some body use so many dutch angles and extreme closeup shots the shot division is lame characters couldn t carry an emotion performances are not to their mark storytelling is worse background is really really terrible babban:- amitabhz been over prioritized to his job varma produced great villains like bikumatre bhavtakur das mallik bhai but this time he failed in carving the all time best characters of hindi cinema there s no comparison of gabbar with babban babban is a more psycho rather than a villain still he has a soft corner for his brother it s a gift in this movie amitabhz performance is not to his mark his appearance itself is pathetic the scar on his nose symbolizes forgotten villains of black and white cinema what ever they worked on babban is not successful babban is no comparison with gabbar narsimha:- the first best thing about this character is not to put audience in suspense about his hands if varma did that it would be like teaching abcd to a bachelor degree holder itz good he opened the secret early but the flashback is pathetic varma couldn t use a great actor like mohanlal to his mark durga:- the only character with betterment this character has been improved with satisfactory changes and was used according to the story heroo raj ghunguroo:- no body bothers or at least considers these character the utter failure of movie starts when director could not work on the close friendship between our heroz these characters carry nothing to this movie ramgopalvarma:- his quality is degrading diminishing aag totally can be treated as a c grade movie sholay is a fire of revenge problem of a town meaning for true friendship and highly appreciated nuisance and fun by dharmendra aag never carried an emotion with its characters storytelling is too weak that it could not make audience feel sympathy for the characters don t compare aag with sholay still u will not like it if you dare watch this movie you will be burnt alive in ramgopal varma ki aag	NEG
christopher guest need not worry his supreme hold on the mockumentary sub-genre is not in trouble of being upstaged in the least especially not by this extremely unfunny jab at rpg-gamers the jokes are beyond lame not enough substance to last the typical length of a particularly rancid snl skit much less the atrocious minutes i waisted watching this drivel the great william katt greatest american hero house deserves much much better one thing and one thing alone makes the fact that i saw this worth it in my mind and that s posting about it on here so hopefully just hopefully i ll save someone such a bad experience my grade: d- dvd extras: audio commentaries; interviews with various cast members; deleted scenes; & theatrical trailer dvd-rom extras: wallpapers easter egg: highlight the eye in the picture on the main menu for a short scene	NEG
i was really disappointed with this film the first waters movie i saw was serial mom and i loved it then i saw pecker and i loved it then i watched polyester and really sort of hated it the only thing i liked about that movie was divine she he had a hell of a lot of talent i was truly surprised as a whole i wouldn t recommend this film 	NEG
 % pure crap and the other % was a brief moment where i thought the blond chick was going to disrobe nope the dialogue was legendarily bad the action sucked and there was no sex the afore mentioned blond chick is modestly dressed alas the whole movie the cgi had the dubious honor of being the worst i ve ever seen on film and the anachronisms were numerous and glaring acting was mediocre even from ben cross and marina sirtis the only names in this movie and marina sirtis looked really really bad i ve seen high school plays more capably produced this is the kind of movie that mst k thrived on heads should roll at sci-fi for allowing this steaming pile on the air 	NEG
first of all i would like to point out that this film has absolutely nothing to see with the dutch folklore story of the ghost ship that is also called the flying dutchman in this film you will not see a single sailing boat you will not see sailors ghosts or anything remotely exciting it is not the story of the ghost ship and i wish they had notified it in the main credits or i wouldn t have watched it because i really thought it was the film about the legend it seems many people think the film has to do with the legend of the ghost ship since the film is listed on the wikipedia page for the flying dutchman legend i don t understand why it is maybe based on the resembling legend called the wandering jew or maybe did they just adapt the worst parts of the legend the film begins with a fight sequence that would let anyone hope the film will have battle scenes unfortunately it is the only battle scene of the film then you see daniel emilfork who was krank in city of lost children for about two seconds and that would let anyone hope the film will have good acting unfortunately he is very bad in the film the same thing can be said about italian actor nino manfredi who was one of italia s best actors ever and who here is condemned to embody a crazy bird wrangler with no back story whose only purpose is to seem to be the wise man of the film and boy does that film need wiseness every other character of the story seems to enjoy swimming in excrement yelling torturing others in excrement fornicating in excrement or laying in excrement some more just for the fun of it it seems to be such fun that each character of the story gets to have his or her turn being dumped in feces at a point or another coming from a dutch director you might think that extreme dirtiness and shockingly real filth are necessary elements in a period piece elements which contributed to make dutch filmmaker paul verhoeven s film flesh + blood such a great film the thought of flesh + blood would let anyone hope that a film similarly filthy and visually straight-forward would be good unfortunately and unlike flesh + blood there is no dramatic progression no fights no good acting and put simply no flesh and blood the photography as the opening sequence unfolds is well-done and enticing this too stops very early in the film the music from nicola piovani of la vità e bella fame is repetitive and annoying when not irrelevant it sometimes implies that there is grandeur in a sequence while on screen the actors are splashing in liquid dung throughout the first act of the film which lasts nothing less than an hour the film takes place within the same perimeter which is around the farm where the main characters live the characters play with excrement a lot drown in it play in it a long period of time elapses through numerous ellipses to allows the main character a young boy who loves to play in excrement to become older and play in excrement some more the bird-man talks a lot to say foolish things in italian spanish conquistadors speak french nothing makes sense everything is confused and takes hours to happen then there is a second act called the ship in which we see what might have been a ship a long time ago but which is now remains of a ship covered with excrement did i mention the main character while walking a bit further away from the farm just happens to run into it and decides it s really cool so let s live in it the hunchback who lived in it before is trying to kill him but he doesn t really mind because did i mention he s not very bright he thinks the ship can navigate and hopes to sail on it until more conquistadors show up at least they seemed to be conquistadors because of the don quixote style hats but as i ve said it s really confused who s who make the dutchman a prisoner along with the retarded hunchback and they burn the ship to the ground the last part of the film which is really hard to bear for the spectator because it just consists of even more excrement with even more retarded middle-age peasants fighting in it takes place in a mad asylum yet more torture and drowning each other with feces yet more loitering for the director who seems to have definitely given up on his job or passed onto the second crew camera assistant to do the rest of the job in the end a lot of the mentally-challenged new friends that the dutchman made die the woman he had sex with who was his brother s wife to begin with tries to have him meet his son the dutchman and his son talk the film ends after two hours of dungy images and calamitous acting and technical performances then the credits roll and the spectator fells immensely free from having to watch atrocious films with no plot that pretend to be something exciting like fantasy films based on legends while they are nothing but a mere catalog of how full of excrement some films can get when they don t have enough financing powers to put battles instead or even horses 	NEG
as i said the book was pretty good and this might have been a good movie if melissa gilbert hadn t been so horrible and unbelievable in the lead roll what kind of accent was that suppose to be anyway it sounded the same as her horrible russian accent in another movie that i have seen her in every time she opened her mouth i cringed it took tries before i was able to watch the entire movie brad johnson was good as the other lead i really liked the beach location scenes they added some much needed brightness to take your mind off of melissa gilberts depressing portrayal i think they could have used san francisco views more to their advantage though it looked like the night scenes were actually sf but i could be wrong i don t recall the character in the book being this depressing please keep melissa gilbert out of any future movies that require an accent 	NEG
jean-marc barr being light the big blue dogville has directed and interpreted this strange movie which is the second installment of some kind of trilogy i might be wrong but i don t think this movie s part of the dogma manifesto though it really looks like it i m not really sure of what i think about this film all actors are good they deliver pretty good performances especially rosanna arquette and jean-marc barr the story is somehow interesting but i don t know there s something about the movie that i don t like the sex scenes are way too long it goes from an interesting work of art to an erotic piece of crap i don t know exactly where it stands sure it s not a bad movie but i won t suggest people to see it neither i ll tell them not to watch just do as you want if you feel curious and you re open-minded give it a try you might like it 	NEG
it took years to complete this film i would think that within those years someone would have said hey this film is terrible i ve seen better acting in porn movies the story is tired and played abused child turns into serial killer how about something new for a change how about abused child turns into a florist at least that would have been a new twist why is it that everyone with a camera and a movie idea especially unoriginal movie ideas thinks that they can be a director i do admire the fact that they stuck with this film for years to get it completed that shows tenacity and spirit with this kind of drive hopefully next time they can focus it on a better script if you want to see a failed experiment in indie film making from a writer director from michigan see hatred of a minute if you want a good movie from a michigan writer director stick with evil dead 	NEG

i was drawn to this movie curious to see how they have adapted hubert shelby s brutal novel i thought that a literary piece of such depth with a rich tapestry of characters horrid situations and social critique could not translate into a bad movie i was wrong this flick is a terrible movie experience not for its content but for its form director ulrich edel executes in my sincere opinion a terrible directorial job that does no justice to the original book no wonder edel is a tv director; this movie looks and feels like a bad made for tv flick some of my views on this bomb spoilers ahead :- lack of directorial creativity the scenes are slow feel slow look poorly shot and barely ever move from an anchored position the only liberty they take is in the cinematography area with a nice dark tone other than that the movie has the same technical creativity as a tv soap-opera - all the actors do a terrific job at portraying these miserable characters the problem is that the adaptation does not tackle a basic element in the development of the plot: motivation all these characters move around like robots without a clear motivation for their action they seem to do things out of the blue like robots for no reason at all edel misses every opportunity to enrich character development by not exploring the character s motivations and by avoiding developing each character s personality to its full extent this lack of character development is blatant on tralala jennifer jason leight does a great job playing this trashy prostitute but her alcohol-induced decision to let the sailors violate her is not explained it looks extremely stupid as we see this character doing this out of the blue this is a clear example of poor character development the movie also has many secondary token characters that do nothing feel nothing and add nothing to the plot i would have liked to learn more about harry s wife for instance and the interaction between the two that s another missed opportunity edel only approaches character development with harry and his fixation with his gay lover only to screw it up at the end not clearly explaining -again- his motivations the thugs are also a joke in their lack of development - the soundtrack is one of the worst i ve ever experienced terrible job by mark knopfler i seriously expected more from the former leader of dire straits but his job in this movie is seriously lacking at times like in the battle between the union workers and the police the music seems totally disconnected from the movie it also feels completely poor and anachronic; i could swear the whole soundtrack was made with a casio toy keyboard it distracts from the actual action - the book adaptation by desmond nakano is so literal that eliminates the point of the story it feels as if they tried so hard to keep the action-by-action storyline in the book that they forgot to actually develop the characters and once again explain their actions and motivations i seriously can not recommend this movie not even to a shelby fan because it can ruin the original book it s a very uninspired effort in adapting the novel and shows very little creative input 	NEG
i think that if i went to a first school somewhere deep in the countryside and asked the bottom set of english to come up with a script it would make more sense than this i could then go to the first year drama group and they would act it out better than the jokers in this film this sounds really mean but i m certain that they made this as a joke and are entirely aware that they possess see what i did there neither the skills to act or to write anything ever watch this only if you re incredibly drunk high or in need of a good excuse as to why your decaying corpse was found with slit wrists i will now go to my fish bowl and collect all of the poo at the bottom after that i will mould it into the shape of a disc and put it into my dvd player fully expecting it to produce something far better than this trumpery acting - plot - lol breasts - 	NEG

american pie has gone a long distance from the first at first i believe the actors don t have a clue what their doing and instead it s just a remake of a college party gone nuts story sets out as two freshman college guys featuring the young stifler setting out the dreams of attending college just to experience the late night parties sex and of course the booze the plot is stupid and comes along way away from the original pie in fact they didn t once again feature an apple pie somewhere in the film luckily i work in a video store and can rent for free but please remember it is a waste of time unless you enjoy brainless sex films with absolute nudity and insane drinking i m a teen myself and i believe even evan almighty would ve been a better choice instead 	NEG
why oh why can t anyone make a decent film out of a legendary tale this is the second adaptation of beowulf i ve been disappointed with in a year but i have to say the previous version beowulf & grendel starring gerald butler was far superior to this that one was only a little disappointing this one is a mess what bugged me most was it the useless plot elements they added in for no particular reason human sacrifices pointless love interest or the bad cgi or the inconsistency of the characters or the uninspired acting even worse was the way they made beautiful marina sirtis look so horrible and lets not even talk about that ridiculous crossbow and why did they continually remind us that beowulf had the strength of men and yet he never showed the slightest sign of such strength throughout the entire film he was tossed around by both monsters he fought relying on his sidekicks to save his bacon even when he slugged the arrogant prince he didn t knock him out he was much too reliant on weapons beo-wimp is more like it this was certainly not the powerful beowulf of the epic poem i d like to end this on a positive note but i can t really think of one offhand all i can say is if you ve ever read beowulf you ll be infinitely disappointed by this dismal inaccurate excuse for an adaptation 	NEG
i found the documentary entitled fast cheap and out of control to be a fairly interesting documentary the documentary contained four mini documentaries about four interesting men each one of these men was extremely involved with his job showing sheer love and enjoyment for one s job the sad part i must say would have to be the subjects in which these individuals worked studied they were interesting for about five minutes afterwards becoming boring and lasting entirely too long the video was filmed in a very creative way though i very much enjoyed the film of one thing with a voice dub over another it played out excellent and also coincided nicely with the music 	NEG
it s hard to say sometimes why exactly a film is so effective from the moment i first came across the stone boy something told me it would be a great film in spite of that it seemed very unlikely that i d ever have the opportunity to actually see it for myself then one day while looking through the online catalogue of my local library i saw that they had recently purchased the dvd release of this film which i m extremely glad for because the cinematography is of a stunning depth and quality that an old vhs copy could never replicate and speaking of the cinematography i must single it out as far and above the most stunning aspect of this film as a photographer who pursues very nearly the exact visual style portrayed in the stone boy i m a firm believer in the fact that a great cinematographer can almost single-handedly carry a film here he has a lot of help from an extremely talented cast and a director who understands perfectly what the story needs but to have juan ruiz anchía behind the camera makes virtually every scene something of beauty and you can almost never say that most films would never even expect such a thing of you scene after scene captures some detail some little bit of visual magic that takes your breath away the director christopher cain has had a long and interesting career as far as i can gather this film is not very representative of it but sometimes to catch a director near the beginnings of his career before all the big budgets and loss of focus there s a real subtle magic to be found cain steps back in this film lets things happen with a life of their own and then ever further much like early john sayles films characters are given space to breathe time to talk side stories happen because they do and that s how life is cain displays a remarkable raw even outright painful understanding of human nature in this film the acting ties much of this story together when people talk when they exist in this film they do so as actual people not held back by the fact that they are playing characters gina berriault s script allows immensely talented and respected actors like wilford brimley robert duvall glenn close and frederic forrest to spend time simply existing whether the things they have to say are minor or of deep significance it all comes down with the weight of pure reality when you look at the actors involved or the great soundtrack by james horner it seems strange that such a film be very nearly forgotten maybe much of what makes the stone boy what it is was the time period it was made in there s this s hangover feeling to this picture that reminds me deeply of my own childhood people talk of the s in terms of modern styles and music but that s not the s i lived in or remember the look of the images the understated and dark knowing quality of the acting and the overall result should get under the skin of any person who grew up in or near this era of time in north america i see myself in this i see how i saw the world and a film like the stone boy sees the world for how it truly is for more of this feeling please see:the black stallion never cry wolf tender mercies testament places in the heart matewan high tide driving miss daisy the secret garden the secret of roan inish wendy and lucy 	POS

the s is a great movie i saw it completely in one night about the hippy movement in the late s although the title would suggest otherwise the first years of the s are not really important in this film the main character of the movie is michael a political activist who goes on the road in the us against the vietnam-war there he meets his girlfriend sarah michael s brother brian goes to vietnam to fight what a surprise he comes back from the war and changes in a tom cruise born on the fourth of july look a like and then into a hippy his dad is a pro-vietnam war type of guy what a surprise michael s sister kate gets pregnant from a rock & roll artist and runs away from home and goes to san francisco during the summer of love the ending is very poor father becomes a liberal and everybody is happy but i let this slip away from my vote the rest of the movie is very good the performances by the actors are pretty good and the soundtrack of the movie is absolutely brilliant all the main events of the sixties are in the movie like the murders on jfk and martin luther king aswell as the big hippy protests the summer of love and woodstock look closely for wavy woodstock speaker gravy what we have in mind is breakfast in bed for as a first aid employee at the woodstock festival in the end the s is a beautiful movie about a beautiful decade 	POS
claire denis has demonstrated repeatedly that film does not need to tell a story that it is sufficient to create an experience that allows the viewer to take the ingredients and make of them what they will ostensibly the idea within the framework of a most non-linear film is the older man living on the french-swiss border a man devoted to his dogs who still has a lover but whose cardiac status increasingly threatens his life he has a son with a little family who infrequently meet with him but when he discovers he is in need of a heart transplant he opts for going to tahiti via japan to obtain a heart transplant on the black market and to rekindle a long lost relationship with a son he had form a tahitian women years ago what denis does with this outline of a story is use her camera to explore the loneliness of the soul the vastness of nature man s interaction with people vs animals etc much of the time the film doesn t make sense but that is because we try too hard to connect all the dots laid out before us in beautiful pictures life is sort of like that: we look see observe integrate process and make of it what we will in using this form of film making much as she did in the strangely beautiful beau travail claire denis has developed a signature technique whether or not the viewer finds the finished product rewarding has much to do with our individual methods of processing visual and conceptual information this is an interesting and visually captivating film but many viewers will find it an overly long discourse about very little perhaps watching again will change that grady harp	POS
it d be easy to call guys and dolls great it s got frank sinatra and marlon brando and contrary to sinatra s original wishes the casting works it s got a really cool s feel even if it is basically transposed from stage to screen with only a little interruption and most of the songs are often a lot of fun and catchy and performed with that wink and nod to the wonderful escapism inherent in the form itself if it s not entirely as great as some others of its ilk it shouldn t be any fault of the filmmaker joseph l mankiewicz not all the songs entirely click and a little of the dialog feels like it s being performed for the stage as opposed to film it s hard to tell at times- brando and sinatra straddle the line so often that one has to watch carefully to tell when one plays for the camera or for the stage while the actress playing adele is better for stage than screen the plot is one of those winners that works well for its period even if one wonders if its influence has stretched to the likes of s she s all that well not quite but close a gambler and -year betrothed played by sinatra wants to host a big-time game but is told that the heat is on meaning the cops are on watch so he has only one choice to host the game with a thousand dollar tab the only way he can get it is through a big-time bet with fellow gambler brando who s put on to make a wild wooing job of a mission worker it allows for the predictable twists in the story in the sudden turn-on-turn-off of the charms of the character of the idiosyncrasies of people from the streets gangsters and dancers and the saitn played by jean simmons who falls for brando it is in its basic concept about this whole world of guys and dolls and how to balance one or the other- obviously without getting married or too compromised mankiewicz brings a lot of energy to the piece even when keeping still with the camera on the subject and his stars are properly reeled in hell even brando works excellently for a musical as he goes beyond being simply the method actor and shows his chops for singing and big-star quality the story and characters eventually wind down to what you d hope will happen and that s fine all we ask for- and what we get- is entertainment in good spurts of witty involving dialog and a few songs and dances that bring the house down my favorites were the number with the lady-cats at the club luck be a lady and the two numbers down in havana cuba a-	POS

i happen to like leslie howard in his better films yet for some reason his performance in of human bondage never has moved me tremendously i first saw the film on my college campus in and the reviewer in the college newspaper made the comment that in the s and s howard played the roles supposedly later picked up by dirk bogard as the man who was born to be betrayed this is not usually the case off hand i think of ashley wilkes as a man who might be betrayed if he and scarlett o hara were meant to be an item by margaret mitchell - but ashley loved melonie not scarlett howard could play any type and a role like r j mitchell or professor henry higgins is not one who is betrayed one can make the case that philip armstrong scott is betrayed by the two strangers he shows hospitality to in th parallel but they are nazis who consider him - a liberal westerner canadian - fair game to double cross in wartime it isn t the same as emotional betrayal and howard does not shrivel up as a result but faces the nazis and captures one after beating him up i think what the reviewer meant was that howard could be soulful - or try to be soulful witness his poet - dreamer - wanderer in the petrified forrest but that character was not betrayed except by history perhaps as he feels his type is as out of date as the gangster played by humphrey bogart the character of philip carey in somerset maugham s of human bondage is soulful too he is sensitive for several reasons he has an interest in art and tries to become a painter - but unlike the artist strickland in the moon and sixpence he has no real talent so he decides to concentrate on medical studies accentuated by a club foot condition he has here he is a man with low self-esteem who is set up to be betrayed philip finds that betrayal in the form of mildred a cockney waitress bette davis who is mercenary and as selfish as they come why philip falls for her is not really addressed in the film but he does find the woman fascinating and she finds him an easy meal ticket ironically in being so captivated by this slut philip fails to notice two other women who are interested in him kay johnson and frances dee and are more fit to be his mate he also keeps finding himself forgiving davis when she has affairs with other men alan hale and reginald denny - the latter a friend of howard s although howard s performance captures the doormat tendency of philip towards mildred he really does not show enough passion until late in the movie when he turns on her that is why i find i never cared for his performance here - it lacks any reality his later tortured insistence in gone with the wind that he loves olivia de haviland not vivian leigh has more consistency with a man in love but the performance of davis as mildred makes the film important she had a wide variety of parts up to like the girlfriend of the deaf pianist in the man who played god or the spoiled heiress who gets murdered in fog over frisco or the mouse-like secretary in three on a match as mildred she finally showed she could be a major actress by playing a selfish bitch curiously her performance was not all of one note while she uses and abuses howard for two thirds of the film culminating in that famous scene where she shows how disgusted his kissing of her made her her last scenes show she too could fall apart due to her health deteriorating and her inability to keep any honest jobs when howard rejects her the viewers fail to note how equally vicious he becomes he asks what happened to her baby - she tells him the baby died and howard says brusquely that he is glad which is hardly the response she expects in the end howard does finally get his life in order but mildred ends a casualty ironically her death discovered by her old boyfriend denny on a medical call the motion picture academy of arts and sciences did fail to nominate davis in leading to the largest write - in campaign in it s history and a permanent change in it s rules but davis was established as a star in one year she won the oscar as joyce heth in dangerous and in two years she co-starred with howard again as equal stars in the petrified forrest 	POS

i really enjoyed this film because i have a tremendous interest in american history the antebellum years and the civil war in particular i purchased it recently from a rack of previously-viewed videos on sale at the supermarket and i was very glad to add this one to my history video collection though not of the caliber of civil war films such as glory or gettysburg provides a lot of history on the pre-civil war brotherhood among cadets at west point maybe it s the gray uniforms the youth or the military discipline but i am fascinated by the story of the corps of cadets from around to the brink of the war i imagine what it must have been like to sit in a classroom with other young men learning how to make war then later putting the lessons to use against your own classmates actually there were two classes graduated in : one class in may the other in june the movie makes no real mention of this except to mention henry a dupont first graduate of the may class; and george custer last grad of the june class the reason for the two classes was not so much about the war but it was the result of switching back to a four-year course of study after a few years of experimenting with a five-year course i think the first class had attended five years the other for four as the movie portrays cadets were like brothers and often had nicknames for each other george fanny or autie custer; alonzo lon cushing; james beauty stuart for j e b stuart class of etc i say this film is santa fe trail as it should have been because that film while enjoyable really fudges history cadets from several different classes are all graduating together jeb stuart and george custer are portrayed as the best of friends and are side-by-side in stopping john brown s insurrection at harper s ferry in fact stuart and custer were never friends but enemies during the war they faced each other for the first time i think at gettysburg in stuart was at the harper s ferry raid but custer was still a cadet at the point when it took place fanny custer plays a role in class of though his classmate chums dev o neill and shelby peyton are fictional i believe they are respectively based on partick henry o rorke and john pelham two people you can look up anyway i truly enjoy this film or any film which provides a window into mid- th century america 	POS

the most important thing about this movie is the brilliant performance by daniel day-lewis and hugh o conor as christy brown guineas artist and fighter who despite of her physical condition overcame all the odds as a person who did work with patients with cerebral palsy i can assure you that their performance were shockingly convincing the enormous support that christy got form his family low-income working class dubliners encouraged him to do the impossible and this picture depicted this support brilliantly have not read the book but the dialogs were written wisely to capture christy brown s witty arrogant personality i do recommend this movie to everyone especially to classic movie-lovers 	POS

the finnish version of robert altman s short cuts set in the small rural town of äänekoski the episodes present a kaleidoscope of the eternal events problems and emotions of human life: joy and love deception and disillusionment hopelessness and death i was particularly impressed by two episodes the first is the story of the young waitress who tries to stir up a romance for his co-workers: she radiates an overwhelming joy of love and life the other episode presents and old man dying in a hospital and his wife trying to help him die with dignity particularly striking is the way the old couple have to fight their way against the humiliating practices of the hospital and their loneliness contrasted with the routines of the hospital crew despite the signs of occasional empathy compared with altman s classic this movie is perhaps less professional but it is definitely a great piece of art 	POS
the trailer for this movie didn t do the movie justice and while the movie didn t know what it really wanted to get across the first half of the movie being a light romance comedy and the second have a more serious romantic drama the overall impact was much better than i thought it would be this movie was more of a date movie but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be kidman being one of my favorites of course i m biased but this movie proved to be a light sensitive if somewhat quirky movie that deserved better three out of four stars 	POS
with films like wallace & gromit and chicken run under their belt the good people from the other side of the pond aardman animation are now introducing us to a bit of their twisted humor in the form of creature comforts derived from a short done early in their careers creature comforts is a slice-of-life show where snippets of conversation are removed from their context and given to an animal of some sort aardman animation went across the country interviewing people with innocuous questions such as are you a liar and then speed things up a bit asking about their sex lives the answers while seeming to be boring and mundane are actually quite funny when you understand the dialogs come first and the animals are added later how many of these animals look like the person making the statements one of the characters discussing what he looks for in a woman i like them kind of thin is an insect the walking stick there are two dogs discussing odors and smells while sniffing the behind of a poodle as they talk about the different smells of a woman there are two birds in a cage as the wife tells the litany that is her health her long suffering husband stands by her saying nothing while it might take some time for creature comforts to find it s legs it should find a place on television for those who are tired of the ordinary while there are more reality shows than carter has liver pills creature comforts is one of a kind and definitely worth watching some of the humor might seem a little racy it s the claymation that catches the attention of the children like the old batman series of the s the jokes are subtle enough the kids won t get them and it s the jokes that are there for the adults 	POS
`mad dog earle is back along with his sad-sack moll marie and that fickle clubfoot velma so are babe and red doc and big mac and even the scenery-chewing mutt pard the only thing missing is a good reason for remaking raoul walsh s high sierra years later without rethinking a line or a frame and doing so with talent noticeably a rung or two down the ladder from that in the original instead of walsh we get stuart heisler for humphrey bogart we get jack palance for ida lupino shelley winters and so on down through the credits the only change is that this time instead of black-and-white it s in warnercolor; sadly there are those who would count this an improvement i died a thousand times may be unnecessary  and inferior  but at least it s not a travesty; the story still works on its own stagy terms earle palance fresh out of the pen near chicago drives west to spearhead a big job masterminded by ailing kingpin lon chaney jr  knocking over a post mountain resort en route he almost collides with a family of oakies when he s smitten with their granddaughter; the smiting holds even when he discovers she s lame arriving at the cabins where the rest of gang holes up he finds amateurish hotheads at one another s throats as well as winters who throws herself at him as does the pooch biding time until they get a call from their inside man at the hotel palance to winter s chagrin offers to pay for an operation to cure the girl s deformity a gesture that backfires then the surgical strike against the resort turns into a bloodbath on the lam palance moves higher into the cold sierras it s an absorbing enough story competently executed that lacks the distinctiveness walsh and his cast brought to it in the year bogie with this role and that of sam spade in the maltese falcon became a star and one last heretical note: those mountains do look gorgeous in color 	POS

and i gave it a high why because it bloody well rocked at the time when there were so many other shows on that were tied to toys games this show was unique in that it had overlapping stories as others have said here it was ahead of its time sadly this is why the show was doomed they have released dvds with episodes of the series so far i am hoping that more come out how does this compare watching it now years after it first came out i don t know i still like it despite the sometimes clunky animation and that imho is it s only flaw the writing was almost top notch and way ahead of the competition i do hope for more dvds or even a set of all the episodes in proper order the dvds are good but i don t think the stories are in their proper order but despite this the show rocked 	POS
after seeing this film at the sf independent film festival i couldn t wait to hear about how to get a copy jim mckay gave a talk q&a about the film afterward which presented his ironic situation: how to get distribution for a film which portrays minorities women non-whites working on resolving controversial issues teen pregnancy teen motherhood racial identity single-mother households and how to write a faithful script on all of these topics being a mid-thirties white male the multi-racial multi-gendered audience of mostly-adults raved about the film s fantastic storyline detailed characters and fantastic portrayal of real teen life most of the teens however had left the building--leading me to think this is a film best seen by adults with kids as a starting point for discussion rather than as many adults there felt a film teens should see because it s about them hence distribution questions--how do we get our hands on it the internet retail would be a great path--this is a film that will be buried like pups or other radical modern teen films--and mckay seemed responsive as for his credits as a writer director mckay was _extremeley_ sensitive and detailed in his work--allying himself to the crown heights neighborhood in which the film is set working with actors to portray characters in their own vision of what they think should be--with the results being disarmingly realistic 	POS

fabulous fantastic probably disney s best musical adventure i have loved this film for over years because it is so imaginative clever and fun even despite the silly flying bed scenes the other scenes and dialog are magical and funny could they have picked anyone better than angela lansbury to play eglantine i cannot think of anyone more suited to the role remaking this classic would be as stupid as remaking mary poppins david tomlinson though he had few quality movie roles absolutely shines in this adventure he was a comic genius who is often forgotten nowadays blustering prim and proper englishman -- nobody could really do slapstick and pull it off as gracefully as he does it would be tragic to remake this film because tomlinson has been deceased for a few years and nobody could step into his shoes and do his character justice the dancing nightgowns and armor have a magical aura about them that other movies with witches just don t capture i particularly enjoy the parts where the germans invade eglantine s house and she must defend it in any way she can bobbing along bobbing along on the bottom of the beautiful briny sea richard and robert sherman outdid themselves on the musical numbers all of them are fantastic and worth remembering portobello road being one of my favorites a great film that still holds up today 	POS

 spoilers included this film surely is the best amicus production i ve seen so far even though i still have quite a few to check out the house that dripped blood is a horror-omnibusan anthology that contains four uncanny stories involving the tenants of a vicious hellish house in the british countryside a common mistake in productions like this is wasting too much energy on the wraparound story that connects the separate talespeter duffel s film wisely doesn t pay too much attention to that it simply handles about a scotland yard inspector who comes to the house to investigate the disappearance of the last tenant and like that he learns about the bizarre events that took place there before all four stories in this film are of high quality-level and together they make a perfect wholesome high expectations are allowed for this film since it was entirely written by robert bloch yes the same bloch who wrote the novel that resulted in the brilliant horror milestone `psycho  we re also marking peter duffel s solid and very professional debut as a director the four stories  chapters if you will  in the house that dripped blood contain a good diversity in topics but they re almost equally chilling and eerie number one handles about a horror-author who comes to the house along with his wife in order to find inspiration for his new book this starts out real well but after a short while his haunted and stalked by the villain of his own imagination the idea in this tale isn t exactly originalbut it s very suspenseful and the climax is rather surprising the second story stars hammer horror-legend peter cushing as a retired stockbroker still haunted by the image of an unreachable and long-lost love he bumps into a wax statue that looks exactly like her cushing is a joy to observe as always and  even though the topic of wax museums isn t new  this story looks overall fresh and innovating this chapter also contains a couple of delightful shock-moments and there s a constant tense atmosphere it s a terrific warm-up for what is arguably the best story: number another legendary actor in this one as christopher lee gives away a flawless portrayal of a terrified father he s very severe and strict regarding his young daughter and he keeps her in isolation for the outside world not without reason since the little girl shows a bizarre fascination for witchcraft and voodoo besides great acting by lee and the remarkable performance of chloe franks as the spooky kid this story also has a terrific gothic atmosphere the devilish undertones in this story along with the creepy sound effects of thunder make this story a must for fans of authentic horror the fourth and final story in which a vain horror actor gets controlled by the vampire-cloak he wears is slightly weaker then the others when it comes to tension and credibility but that the overload of subtle humor more or less compensates that there s even a little room for parody in this story as the protagonist refers to co-star christopher lee in the dracula series most memorable element in this last chapter is the presence of the gorgeous ingrid pitt the cult-queen from `the vampire lovers certainly is one of the many highlights in the filmher cleavage in particular no doubt about itthe house that dripped blood will be greatly appreciated by classic horror fans i truly believe that with a bit of mood-settling preparations this could actually be one of the few movies that ll terrify you and leave a big impression intelligent and compelling horror like it should be highly recommended one extra little remark though: this film may notrepeat may not under any circumstances be confused with `the dorm that dripped blood this latter one is a very irritating and lousy underground s slasher that has got nothing in common with this film except for the title it stole 	POS
sisters in law is made by the same directors of the rather curiously fascinating divorce iranian style which was as exactly as it stated as we got a glimpse of divorce court in iran now they ve turned their attention to the court system in cameroon africa what s great about this court is that of the magistrates are women which is unusual for such a country like this anyways they deal with plenty of men used to getting their way around the women but this film is remarkable in the fact that it appears that women has made great strides in society with divorce legal and women s rights being recognized so the judges often chastise the men for behaving in a primitive way in these times not to say that the women who appear at the court get the softer treatment one of the prime focuses of the film is a case of child abuse done by an aunt the judges waste no time in lashing out at the woman with fury and who said that justice isn t served anymore with these behind the bench they often carry out maximum penalties ya you go girl 	POS

i saw this film in winnipeg recently - appropriate given the location used i first read lawrence s book back in the s and for me it s always been a very powerful picture of the trials of aging in our society it resonated when i was young and it resonates even more now when the film came out i was keen to see if the story could survive and was thoroughly impressed especially with ellen burstyn s performance she manages to give us a complete human being even though the character is generally cranky and judgmental - someone that you wouldn t want to live with it s great to be able to see favourite characters come to life so authentically 	POS
a warm sweet and remarkably charming film about two antagonistic workers in the same shop james stewart and margaret sullavan who are carrying on a romance via mailbox without either of them knowing it the key to this film s success is that ernst lubitsch keeps any syrupy sentimentality absent and calls on his actors to give low-key unfussy performances as a result you fall in love with virtually all of them there s a strong undercurrent of melancholy running through this film which i appreciated loneliness is a major theme most obviously represented in the character of the shop s owner and manager played wonderfully by frank morgan he discovers that he s being cuckolded by his wife and realizes that the successful life he s created for himself isn t enough to keep him from feeling lonely when he doesn t have a partner to share it this makes the timid romance between stewart and sullavan all the more poignant because they re both reaching out to this unseen other who each thinks of as a soulmate before they ve even met of course we know everything will turn out right in the end but the movie doesn t let you forget the dismal feeling either of them would feel if they found that the reality didn t live up to the fantasy lubitsch fills his movie out with a crackerjack cast that has boatloads of chemistry the little group of shop employees refers to itself throughout the movie as a little family and that s exactly how it feels to us as well this is a wonderful unsung romance grade: a+	POS

i had heard good things about this film and was you guessed it a bit disappointed reese witherspoon is as promised surprisingly good surprisingly confident at a young age; really all the small cast are quite solid in their simple s american setting the reason i didn t rate this film higher is mainly that towards the end the grief shown by the older sister didn t seem so real and this pulled me out of the film a bit perhaps we are expected to fill in the plot or perhaps the film needed to be a bit longer maureen s character is quite underdeveloped i think it is understandable that dani reese w the younger would be traumatised and angry but why is her sister shown to be more upset because she s a few years older hasn t the end rather undermined the rest of the film the pacing of the movie makes it seem that maureen and court have only just met when he gets tractored warning: this scene is surprisingly brutal in retrospect it seems like it might have been trying to shock a bit well it works it depends what you want - if you want the girls happy story of young love that it seems like you re going to get you re in for a surprise man in the moon is both quaint and dreamy and a harsh coming of age film  a rather awkward combination i liked the character of court though i can see what girls watching this might be watching and i loved that they had the courage to both let him hurt the younger sister most men would most films wouldn t and get killed on my pretty harsh ratings scale for some reason i found jason london on a tractor funny 	POS

some genre films need to be dressed up this one was an exception taken on its own merit it s a dressed down version of the horror genre film with minimal special effects it manages to be a psychological study of sorts with a simple yet existential theme - who gets hit by the bus and why her it s not a great film yet because there is little contrived about it the story works subtle and all about the interactions of the characters actually there is one contrivance in the opening scenes but it may have been placed there to simply set the tone for what s to come i very much appreciate the balance of male and female energy and would not recommend this story to anyone interested in more than people reacting to a physical and psychological challenge you will enjoy the film if you have some empathy value the need for a bit of adventure in your life and wonder what would i do in this situation 	POS

one of the best of the fred astaire and giner rogers films great music by irving berlin solid support from randolph scott harriet nelson lucille ball betty grable frank jenks and astrid allwyn terrific songs include let yourself go let s face the music and putting all my eggs in one basket the last song is introduced by astaire playing a jazzy piano and then a cute dance with rogers rogers also sings let yourself go with grable among the backup singers harriet nelson then hilliard sings two nice songs and plays rogers mousy sister get thee behind me is a song that sticks with you for days she also sings but where are you snappy and fast paced this entry in the astaire-rogers series is one of the better ones the classic and amazing beautiful finale let s face the music and dance is among the best-known of their numbers rogers wears one of the great dresses in movie history a shimmering sequined number that swirls around her legs as she dances weighted hem and is also slightly see through just gorgeous this is the number that steve martin and bernadette peters re-created in pennies from heaven randolph scott seems an odd choice as astaire s pal but he also appeared in their roberta with irene dunne luckily he does not attempt to sing or dance it seems that grable and ball would have had bigger parts in but they have a few scenes and make little impact allwyn has the bigger role but is only ok rogers has one of her best solo numbers in the series with let yourself go jazzy and thumping it s a great song fun all the way although i got tired of we joined the navy after the third time 	POS
many critics have felt offended that r w fassbinder has portrayed both protagonist wilkie and the nazis in this movie in a human-like manner connoisseurs of other fassbinder films however will realize that lili marleen belongs to fassbinder s women movies like the marriage of maria braun and lola fassbinder was convinced that stories can be told much better with women than with men because according to fassbinder while men usually fulfill their determined roles in society women are capable of thinking in a dialectic manner dialectics however means that there is not only a thesis and its antithesis like usually in our black-and-white world but a synthesis where the oppositions coincide moreover dialectic means that because of the third instance of synthesis the absolute opposition of the difference between thesis and antithesis is abolished concretely speaking: starting from a dialect point of view and portraying the fascist state the underground fighters must necessarily use the basic means like the rulers do and between offenders and victims there is thus a chiastic relation so that every offender is also victim and every victim is also offender fassbinder has illustrated this abstract scheme that transcends classical logic in his play the city the garbage and the death which was filmed by daniel schmid under the title shadow of angels therefore approaching an a priori controversial topic like nazi germany in a dialectic manner the depiction of this time in the form of a movie gets even more controversial especially for people who cannot or do not want to see that our recognition of the world is by far not exhausted with a primitive light-switch schema but needs the third instance of synthesis as controlling instance of its opposite members thesis and antithesis the mutual relationship between offenders and victims has to scrutinized since it is simply not true that the offenders are the bad ones and the victims the good ones in a synthetic viewpoint the bad ones participate on the goodness as the good ones participate on the badness they are mutually related in a world-view based on classical logic a relation between good and bad cannot even been established and in an ethics based on this insufficient system of logic the bad conscience of the survivors of nazi germany feeling illogically enough responsible for the deeds of their ancestors exclude the possibility of a relationship between the two extremes and thus a synthesis in the form a new evaluation based on this relationship as well from fassbinder s dialectic viewpoint it follows that neither lili marleen nor lola nor maria braun can be condemned for their misuse of the ruling system for their private purposes because they don t misuse them they just use them in the opposite since victims must repeat the actions of the offenders as the offenders must repeat the actions of the victims because good and bad are no longer simple mirror images of one another like in two-valued logic their strategies are legitimated by the chiastic structure of a logic that describes our world that is not black and white at all much better than a black-and-white logic 	POS

this is like crouching tiger hidden dragon in a more surreal fantasy setting with incredible special effects and computer generated imagery that would put industrial light and magic to shame the plot may be hard to follow but that is the nature of translating chinese folklore to the screen; certainly the overall story would probably be more familiar to its native audience however an intelligent person should be able to keep up; moreover the martial arts scenes potency are amplified by eye popping cgi 	POS

ok after reading a couple of reviews on atlantis: the lost empire i just want to clear up some misunderstanding as to it being a direct rip off from nadia: secret of the blue water the only part that was a ripoff from nadia is that the pendant from nadia and the pendant from atlantis bear so much resemblence in terms of how it s used origins and how it s created from the source of life that there s no doubt about it being copied if you want to consider how kida and nadia is dressed alike then you could put that against disney too it was kind of wierd for nadia and kida to wear that bikini style clothing in an adventure sci-fi not to mention they both move in a similar style too as an anime fan i have to agree there s some degree of copying but it s only on the minor details and even though not many of the ideas are original like the encryption design on the wall in laputa the ancient mask from princess mononoke the resemblence of the vehicles to the garfish submarine in nadia etc the plot itself i believe it s highly original and it s quite amazing that disney can pull it off without the use of captain nemo the main character in jules verne s k leagues under the sea which is also the main character in nadia as for mylo and jean wearing similar style glasses as shown in the novel lord of the flies glasses is a symbol of wisdom and intelligence i think mylo jean the main character from stargate and a dozen of other intelligent characters would look kind of unfit for the role if they went in without glasses as for the submarines and how the submarines fight with those wide blast torpedos which really resembles what nautilius does i want to state that it s a required element for either one if atlantis is involved in the plot after all it s a sunken city beneath the waters as for the crew having some charactistical resemblence with the crew from nautilius in nadia it might be the artwork but i don t sense any copyright infringement there as the character s personalities were perfectly original to me as an anime fan that rated nadia as the # best anime i ever watched even now today i do have my doubts about atlantis when i first saw the preview but now that i watched the movie i once again regained my confidence with disney and have high hopes for their future movies after atlantis overall the best disney movie yet without me shivering at the sound of their songs at the middle of the movie and it s a plus that they revised their cheesy scripts to make it even better also it s amazing that they actually portray the bad guys look normal with out making them overly evil in the beginning i was wondering who the bad guys are and only the blonde girl kind of resemble the looks of a bad character in terms of how disney draws it aka make the bad guys look really menacing 	POS

he is the quintessential narcissist and manipulator; in this case portraying attorney and murderer tom capano kathryn morris is sympathetic as victim anne marie fahey but in the beginning is a bit too much the victim we are sorry for the situation but become simultaneously disgusted after seeing his victimization of several other women including rachel ward as well the sad part is where she is actually getting help with her self-esteem issues and capano actually had her psychologist killed pretty hard to believe but this was based on a true story there is a cameo with olympia dukakis excellent as capano s mother all in all an interesting story because it is based on a true murder and you will want to read ann rule s book to get the accurate details 	POS

i ve been trying to find out about this series for ages thank you imdb i saw this as a child and have never quite been able to get it out of my mind as a -year old of course i was particularly struck by the episode of the cyclops which was absolutely chilling i talked about it so much that my older brother made me a cyclops out of a plastic cave man figurine which i still have what i also remember though was the atmosphere which was unusual right from the beginning - mysterious austere and extremely authentic when i read the original many years later i experienced that same sensation it s a very hard thing to capture - and probably impossible in hollywood every odyssey i ve seen since has been an enormous let-down the characters in this series seemed genuine real people - ancient greek people - and not some hollywood stars in costumes this is a real masterpiece but - why is it not better known and why isn t it available on vhs or dvd i would just love to have the chance to see this again 	POS
when i went to watch this movie my expectations were really low but i was pleasantly surprised i thought i was going to watch a boring teen-flick but in fact the plot is interesting and well executed the acting was somewhat convincing - especially from melville who really shows his talent in this movie and the fight scenes were - for a low budget movie - very well done i think this movie deserves a broader audience than it has received it is a movie which can be seen by the whole family - maybe not the smallest of kids since it contains some rather rough scenes a movie about love and the problems that can occur when you go against your family traditions yes the movie is very much like bend it like beckham but i actually think this movie pulls it off better 	POS

just got through watching this version of samhain and even though i still like it it s nothing like the rough cut version i have if you check the message board you ll see an apology from the director for this cut down version minutes and he says he had nothing to do with this r-rated trimmed down edit with a completely new screwed up ending christian really doesn t need to distant himself that much because the basic gore elements still stand up even though highly trimmed down this is a damn shame because this had the potential of being one of the goriest and best gore films in years it still has the porn stars and the inbreds and some of the extreme gore can at least be partially seen i m just glad i have that rough cut because to me it s a jewel for any gorehounds library christian viel definitely has the skill and vision to deliver the goods and hopefully his next project will be better produced the idiots had a near classic in their hands and screwed it up for everybody samhain may be one of the most controversial and mishandled horror movies ever and too bad gorehounds didn t get to see what the director intended just so you know what you missed this is my review based upon the work print of samhain the movie runs a little over minutes and has no chapter stops there is absolutely no music soundtrack and some of the scenes have no audio on the dialog because i think they are meant to be looped in later however most of the movie does have audio with sound affects and when an effect or scene is missing a message appears as a cue for insertion when the movie is completed it s exactly as it says a rough cut but the only uncut version of samhain you are ever likely to see reason because the gore is extremely graphic much more than even an nc- would allow yes there are a few porn stars but they are just there for the killing and to add a little sugar and spice the story is pretty standard american tourists on a vacation in ireland and end up staying in a home in the middle of the woods an area that is heavy on folklore involving the ancient druids and the celebration of samhain or as we call it halloween spooky the movie starts off with a huge dose of gore as a camping couple is attacked by one of the local inbred mutants this is a great gore scene as the guy find his girl hanging from a cliff with her crying for help all he sees is her head arms and shoulders hanging in front of him and when he pulls her up she has been completely sliced in two this is what i would call extreme gore with entrails blood and severed limbs all over the place we are in herschell gordon lewis territory here folks except the effects look much more realistic i m going to just skip the story because it s your standard stalk and kill plot the next gore scene is something to behold as the boyfriend from the first killing is taken to a cave like location tcm- stuff and bound to a table this geek then cuts all of his limbs off off camera with a cue to insert a scene and then we see his torso on a barbecue pit turning slowly over a fire and the torso has a hard-on if you can believe that yes very bad taste gross gruesome you find the right word and it will probably fit too then later jenna jameson her beautiful body and all is cut from neck to crotch and all her entrails are pulled out in graphic glee and her blood drains into a pot yummy a real turn on huh but the best gore scene happens inside the house and i have to admit this is one of the best gore scenes i have seen this guy doesn t matter who is caught from behind from a geek and cut open at the ass hole the geek then puts his hands in and rips out all the guys entrails intestines and what the hell ever else there is right from his asshole this goes on forever as the guy is screaming and more and more innards are pulled out laying all over the bathroom floor this is so extreme so over the top that i found myself laughing all to hell obviously you will never ever see this scene on a proper dvd imo along with most of the other really extreme gore scenes so what to think of all of this well first of all even though i doubt this movie would ever be released in this totally uncut presentation it makes this rough cut a rare jewel for gorehounds yes it s a little difficult at first with no soundtrack a few scenes to still be inserted and credits that have missing names all over the place but that s what makes this so unique and i wouldn t trade it for anything right now extreme gore yes yes extreme extreme gore this makes haute tension look like a disney movie 	POS
basically this movie is one of those rare movies you either hate and think borders on suicide as the next best thing to do rather than having to sit through it for two hours or as in my case you see it as a kult hit one of those movies wherein the humour the plot the acting is actually very hidden but for those of us willing to go looking for it trusting the director well the reward is: u laugh your a of the fact that u have to find the things mentioned above actually makes the movie even more funny because u get the impression the director isn t even aware of how funny his movie is which doesn t seem likely and therein lies the intelligence at the helm of this magnificient project called : spaced invaders 	POS

what a surprising treat to come across on late television had i only read a brief plot rundown on a television listing before seeing the movie i would have passed the idea of a movie about a hit-man-seeing-a shrink-wanting-to leave-the-business-and-falling-in-love sounds trite but the film works from the start of the movie it s clear the man carries a weight on his shoulders before he even says a word the look and feel of the film is perfect dark but not obnoxiously so aside from the hit-man family aspect which provides a touch of surrealism macy s character grapples with his marriage and his father s control macy shows a repressed sadness and his bedtime talks with his young son are amazing the young boy shows acting skills well beyond his years and the interaction between the father and son is so very natural personal and loving this is one of the best movies i ve seen in a while and i can t believe i came across it by accident on late night television 	POS
norman is that you was this is all third hand so take it with a grain of salt adapted to an african american family from a jewish one when it made the transition off stage and onto screen also it was one of those movies originally filmed in video so the prints from the theater can t have been that great still performances by redd foxx and others were pretty good what i wanted to tell you all is that the movie is a period piece: it reflected the attitudes in the mid to early s about finding out you have a gay son or daughter in your family for that reason alone it s pretty interesting- if not a little hollywood don t believe me check out lines about curtains etc very stereotypical not too deep but the movie really shines in a couple of areas there is a side splitting scene when redd foxx is trying to find his wife who s run away with his brother to ensenada in a souped up pinto the phone conversation across the border is really memorable but the best scene in the movie is when wayland flowers and madame did his their gay routine that he used to do in gay bars and nightclubs to the best of my knowledge this is the only time that routine was filmed and it s a slightly cleaned up and much shorter version i m told still it s vintage madame and shouldn t be missed people are still stealing lines from wayland; the man was truly gifted enjoy the movie 	POS

this film is being described as a comedy but it wasn t a comedy at all like any panahi film it was a very realistic drama depicting the common thread of social inequity and hypocrisy but it was very funny; much lighter than the director s dark and serious the circle my favourite iranian film the resourcefulness of the girls and the banter between them and the soldiers was both completely believable as if it were a documentary and completely hilarious the filming the actual match and aftermath was astonishing it added a realism much like australia s kenny of course a very different film the performances from all the non-professional actors  soldiers and girls  were very credible it was very moving to see the passion disappointment and excitement of these girls anyone in this country who thinks muslim girls wearing a chador are any different to their own daughters should go see this film  it will be a real eye-opener to me the soldiers represented the current paradigm they started out with stock-standard official policy responses to all the pleas of the girls as the film progressed they found it more and more difficult to maintain this stance when what seems like all of teheran breaks out into wild celebration everyone is caught up in it and the ridiculousness of the current policies is obvious to one and all it was a very moving and unexpected ending and gave the film a really nice blend of emotions frivolity drama and social commentary though it s adult cinema i think mature-minded children from about seven onwards would really appreciate this film as long as they can read subtitles it is remarkable that a repressive country like iran is able to produce films of such quality by the likes of panahi and kiarostami perhaps the constraints there force directors to be extremely resourceful australian and other film makers could take a leaf out of their book 	POS
wow this film is the best living testament i think of what happened on - - in nyc compared to anything shown by the major media outlets those outlets can only show you what happened on the outside this film shows you what happened on the inside it begins with a focus on a rookie new york fireman waiting for weeks for the first big fire that he will be called to fight the subject matter turns abruptly with the only existing footage of the first plane to hit the towers you are then given a front-row seat as firefighters rush to the scene into the lobby of tower one in the minutes that precede the crash of the second plane and tower two s subsequent fall you see firemen reacting to the unsettling sound of people landing above the lobby it is a sight you will not soon forget heart-rending tear-jerking and very compelling from the first minute to the last deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentary films ever made we must never forget 	POS

after a cold sex scene between andy and gina in south america we know that andy is a payroll manager who finds himself in a hard economic situation where he badly needs some extra money we also discover that he has been stealing from his job and using the money to his drug habits he s also attempting to keep up with his wife who just might be having an affair to solve all their problems he persuades his brothera likable loserto join him in a plan to steal their own parent s small store their parents are happily married and proprietors of a jewelry store situated in new york s westchester county sixty thousand dollars is all they ll need to get their life out of desperation three main characters are important in this moviefirst the two brothers each of them is a complex individual threatened with multiple motivations and sunk into doubts and disappointments the two are desperate characters financially and emotionallyandy is selfish he feels that he has never had the love of his father he is the corrupting influence turning his brother into an assailant and his beautiful woman into an adulteresshank is a puppet too weak to resist his brother s wishes his ex-wife is one of the reasons he needs money as he owes her hundreds in child support he longs to regain the confidence he once had with his father the third character is their weary and deplorable father charles hanson albert finney especially in the haunting climactic scenestelling you more about the details could lessen the impact of the film and therefore the entertainment tomei s performance conveys great depth and emotion even with her look her touch her particular movelumet s direction is firm fresh and brutal 	POS

kudos to the writers of this film for creating a supremely engaging drama the curious character development is indicative of a nuanced and well schooled writing team the audience member cannot but help but to feel that s he must make wrenching emotional decisions pitting the cerebral against the libidinal the viewer has an opportunity to develop the character herself though her predictions are rarely validated credit is also due to the filmmakers for breathing life into the setting the wood-shop is transformed into a unique persona as the film unfolds with its own traits faults a variety of highly charged relationships and of course a fate inexorably tied to that of the other principals make sure to catch this one at your local art-house 	POS

i saw this film at the chicago reeling film festival to pick up on the previous reviewer s remarks the claustrophobic feel and off colors of the film is i sense quite intentional and conveys the sense of limited space drab architecture overall drabness that constitutes the urban environment of most people in eastern and central europe a bit shabby housing project style is how i d describe it and this is how many people live on the outskirts of larger cities i can t say that i m familiar with bucharest romania where the action unfolded but i have visited and lived in eastern europe for six months when i visited russia as a student for a semester my entire group had to drag their luggage seven stories up the staircase of a shabby student dorm building just as the heroine does when moving in with a woman because the elevators weren t working but i do concur with the reviewer that the claustrophobia and muted colors it s overdone for there are to be sure beautiful historic buildings parks squares you can find in bucharest or in any historic city center of eastern europe and bucharest s didn t get much of any footage in this film for me watching this film conveys well the claustrophobia that i would feel during my half-year stay there feeling trapped and limited it makes you see why someone would want to immigrate and find a better life just as people if hope to escape from a united states urban ghetto also given the climate of homophobia say circa us in the s the two young women who fall in love with one another are forced to keep their love a very private matter; hence the focus on their interaction in the apartment it s remarkable and commendable in my view that this queer themed film was even made in romania and i find the complaint of the previous reviewer about the poor film quality quite uninformed and patronizing it s unlikely that the director and producer drummed up much government support and funding for their film and they did the best they could with their likely limited resources the actors were fairly good and believable; the dialog was overall well done and i could identity with these women the film offers an added twist to that of forbidden love between two young women kiki an energetic fun-loving free spirit with a dark troubling secret her admiration and love for an abusive incestuous brother sandu falls in love with alexandra a bright bookish idealistic young woman who moves to bucharest to begin her college studies opposites attract and their personalities seem to complement one another though there is some tension between the ambitious studious intellectual alexandra and kiki who seems to be attending college to please her parents keeping their love hidden from their parents seems manageable though we don t get any sense of the tension it requires nor do we ever see or meet any other students--hard to believe--and the tension keeping their love secret would have entailed the chief threat to their love is kiki s brother and her difficulty in trying to severe her relation to him but kiki s love for alexandra seems to give her the strength she needs to finally severe this bond or does it that s what the suspense of the film focuses on as the narrative develops and i won t say how it concludes ironically kiki s love sickness isn t love for another woman but her illicit incestuous love for her brother thus loving a woman offers the potential cure to the sickness of loving a sibling though this feel of this film is stifling and claustrophobic overly confined to interactions between kiki and alexandra it was still engaging and moving to watch so i ll give it a 	POS
my roommate had bought this documentary and invited me to watch it with her she s from china and only heard so much about and wanted to know the cold hard truth and she wanted me to tell her more after the documentary i felt awful watching this documentary it was like reliving the nightmare and it still brings tears to my eyes but i m extremely grateful that i watched this documentary because on the day of september th i m sure we all remember where we were and what we were doing when we heard all of us could only think certain questions: why how what s going on oh my god almost all the americans were grateful for the brave firemen and policemen that risked their lives to save others but i don t think we thought about what they were really going though this wasn t actually supposed to be a documentary about the cameraman was just filming a typical day on the job and they just happened to be a couple blocks away from the world trade centers and got everything outside and in on tape on sep th i thought to myself it s ok the policemen and firemen will get the people out that survived to be honest i thought it was an accident i was in my junior year of high school and getting changed from gym and getting ready to go to my science class someone came into the locker room shouting some building just got bombed in new york we all got dressed quickly and ran to our classrooms as we watched the first tower burning on tv not only seconds later live on tv does the second plane crash into the other world trade center and we knew this was no accident a few minutes later we heard about the pentagon and that there was a plane headed for chicago but was shot down so many thoughts ran through our heads and i kept on thinking what are the firemen and policemen going to do but it s procedure to them i thought they ll know what to do the first tower collapsed we knew it so many lives are now gone the second tower crashed things would never be the same those firemen in this documentary showed courage confusion and strength the real raw human emotions they didn t know what to do they were just as scarred as those other people who were in the towers they heard the bodies collapsing on the ground from people jumping out the windows and here i was in a classroom just crying seeing all that was going on on tv i was amazed with this film and just wanted to go to new york and tell them how grateful all the americans were for their help i know they feel like they were just doing their job but they did more they were hero s every day after sep th for weeks they kept on digging knowing that there were no survivors but they kept on hoping and praying may god bless their kind and brave hearts as for my roommate she was crying and admitted this was her first time crying at these attacks she got to see the truth of what had happened that tragic day she asked why i didn t know what to say it breaks my heart that people can be that evil it sounds clique but it was a normal day for everyone one of the firemen said in the documentary no one expected this to happen not like that those people in the world trade centers or the pentagon or the planes that were hijacked they were just doing their job happen to be there or even just was there for a second passing by they were not just murdered they were slaughtered and those hijackers did it with a song in their heart then seeing in the middle east all the people celebrating why do people do this they celebrated death and the lose of: mothers fathers sisters brothers friends grandparents aunts uncles cousins etc why so thanks to those people for making this documentary you truly think about the firemen policemen and the troops in iraq and it keeps your hope up that there are good people in this world thank you to all those people you are our heroes 	POS
what s inexplicable firstly the hatred towards this movie it may not be the greatest movie of all time but gimme a break it got oscars for a reason it made eighteen hundred million dollars for a reason it s a damn good movie which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it i have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when i saw it in theaters i ve rewatched it on tv and video and it had none of the impact it had when i saw it on the big screen twice or maybe three times actually but that might be it the appeal of it it s a movie yes capital m there it s an epic it s a spectacle in the order of gone with the wind or ben hur now ben hur and gone with the wind seem kinda hokey to me with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama not that titanic has none of that well the acting was actually very good the melodrama was quite heavy-handed at times but the reason titanic works is that it s such an emotional ride i usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind or give me a visual thrill this movie isn t exactly dumb but it s not cerebral at all the visual thrills are simply means to an end to fuel the emotions of the audience i didn t cry when bambi s mom died i don t react to tearjerkers but this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million an emotional rollercoaster that if it were a regular one would make buzz aldrin scream like a little girl and i m sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it and have a ready supply of cynicism then you can thoroughly dislike this movie but if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt you ll enjoy it completely and look at the top ten grossing films of all time is a single one of them bad is a single one of them worth a score of out of no not even the phantom menace and this movie made billion dollars worldwide it can t be bad not possible p s how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman spiderman was a fun movie but it was a total kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did it simply wasn t anything all that special no one will remember it in years but i m pretty sure titanic will be remembered 	POS
this delighted audiences at a number of film festivals and it is not hard to see why director yang zhang with the help of some very nice work by the three principle actors xu zhu as the father master liu; quanxin pu as the elder son da ming; and especially wu jiang as the irrepressible and lovable younger son er ming spins a tale that will warm the coldest heart the film starts with a man taking a shower in an automated booth in the middle of beijing he puts some money in a slot opens the door takes off his clothes and puts some of them on a conveyor belt to be cleaned steps into the shower and gets cleaned with brushes and squirts of water and soap as though he s a car at the car wash this is the future symbolically speaking and the old bathhouse we will see in the next scene is the past agrarian china is giving way to industrial china pollution cultural revolution hang-over industrialization blues no way what we have here is a celebration of people and their kindness and love for one another a celebration of goodness in the hearts of men yet i wonder how the chinese government views this film on the one hand it clearly presents a pleasant view of china and its people it is stringently nonpolitical without criticism of the present regime expressed or implied yet there is the slightest sense that the good old ways are going to be replaced by something that may not be as good i think yang zhang had the wisdom to just let that be as it may tell a story about old men at the bathhouse where they get back rubs and massages where they tell tall tales and reminisce about the good old days where they can relax and play chinese chess and stage cricket fights where the master is a spry and wise old guy and his assistant is his son who may be retarded or autistic but who does his job with glee and an infectious spirit of fun and good will enter back on the scene the older son da ming who is polished well groomed and taciturn he is uncomfortable with what he sees as the unsophisticated behavior of his father and brother he represents modern china with his tie and his briefcase his cell phone and his education he has only returned because he thought his father was dying when he sees that this is not true he packs his bags and is set to return to his wife and his career but then a crisis ensues and it is during this crisis that da ming sees the value of the natural people-centered life that his father and his brother have been living and so yang zhang reconciles the old and the new and does so in such a charming manner that i will not object especially since his style is so neat and so carefully expressed one of the nice things he does that i miss in most movies is the way he dovetails the subplots within the larger story so that they are resolved before the picture ends the bathhouse regular who sings o sole mio in the bathhouse as the water showers down upon him much to the delight of er ming finds that he can t sing in public because of stage fright near the end of the film he loses his stage fright and sings thanks to some inspired help from er ming and the bathhouse regular who is losing his wife because well he tells a tale to master liu before he confesses the real reason but liu understands and again before the movie is over husband and wife are reconciled this kind of happy ending movie-making is unusual in today artistic and international films or in almost any film directed at adults some happy endings are so contrived as to embarrass not only their contrivers but their audiences and some are so blatantly condescending that the audience is offended here however the audience is delighted see this especially for the comedic performance by wu jiang whose warm effervescence overcomes any handicap his character may have 	POS

i was really looking forward too seeing this movie as it has been advertised as a must-see movie for people that love movies about nature the movie shows different climates and the animals associated with them by starting at the north pole and going down south as the movie progresses the footage from this movie is often breathtakingly beautiful and i many times wondered how on earth they could have taken some of the shots under water or in the sky however beautiful a large part of the footage i had already seen in the tv series planet earth narrated by david attenborough i found attenborough s narration of planet earth to be much better than the narration of earth earth is an easier movie it skips much of the scientific detail that attenborough covers in his planet earth series for instance earth will tell you that a tropical sea is an ideal nursery for a young humpback whale because there are few predators planet earth will tell you that a tropical sea is a good nursery because the water is low in oxygen and doesn t contain enough nutrients to support very large animals like large sharks etc to me that s an important difference that together with attanborough s far superior voice make planet earth a far better documentary than earth still however i think earth is worth watching for the beautiful footage and the fact that it s easier to understand makes it interesting for children too 	POS

we have to remember that the s were practically a blank slate when it came to movies hollywood was in transition from patriotic war movies noir two reel oaters etc to movies with a message we had blackboard jungle on the waterfront and so on some folks might think that was an improvement i don t who was the mogul who said: if you want to send a message call western union he was right these psychological thrillers are less entertainment than some kind of remote therapy this one is a pip it s about three sisters trying to wrest control of their dead father s estate one of them maybe the only one worth redemption enlists the aid of the company pilot to help her keep the rest of the family at bay he s initially in it for the bucks but eventually falls for her meanwhile the rest of the family schemes to sabotage the romance the results are predictable you get a little bit of everything in this movie sexual tension between the sisters a little subtle masochism hereditary insanity - if there is such a thing we never get to meet the parents but they must really have been screwed up the cast is practically unknown one or two of the actors sound vaguely familiar the acting is so bad it s hard to believe it was released under the united artists umbrella by a company called bel-air productions it was shot in and around la mostly at night and probably without permits the end was so bizarre that i thought it was a joke it was as if they ran out of money and the producer decided to wrap it up in the middle of a scene i can t explain it - not even to myself - but i gave this pile of trash an i m familiar with the term it s so bad it s good but i don t think i ever ran into the phenomenon before well maybe hot rods to hell but this one certainly fits you might want to try this if you love movies that seem like they were made in somebody s basement 	POS

this is a superb movie suitable for all but the very youngest though accessibility for younger people was marred at least in the print which i saw by the use of some unfortunate choice of english sub-titling for much of the film it is almost impossible to guess in which time-period it is set - there is no modern technology shown not even the ubiquitous chinese bicycle just a drab almost monochrome everyday life against which is contrasted the dazzling display of the sezuan opera and of celebratory fireworks even when a group of soldiers refer to their imminent departure for a theatre of war this could still be any time in the past years but then we briefly see a motor car - late s early s style - and we realise that we are watching a china on the verge of huge upheavals and that much of the world we are seeing is about to be swept away in the cataclysm of world war and the communist revolution which makes the central character s desire to adhere to old customs and traditions all the more poignant but the film also raises issues which are of vital importance even today both within china and in other parts of the world: the inequality between boys and girls men and women; the trade for various purposes in young children; corruption in society; injustice; the importance of friendship maybe i m reading too much into this film; but i don t think so i also think that it is a scandal that films of this calibre are often not shown in the united kingdom whilst dross is passed off as quality material but don t get me started on that 	POS
 haven t seen this film haven t even heard of this film it wouldn t surprise me one of the few truly independent films produced in the last ten years no studio had faith in the picture and it was never picked up for major distribution the independent company kino films gave boesman and lena a very limited run with virtually no promotion and the majority of major film critics didn t even bother reviewing it i guess a movie based on a one act one set play about the apartheid and its affect on two individuals never really had a chance in today s market - and it s the intelligent film-lover s loss for the record both angela bassett and danny glover deserved ocsar nominations as did the cinematographer but the film received such little fanfare that i can t even blame the academy on that one this is a film that is challenging thought-provoking and heartbreaking and it actually requires the audience to meet it on it s own terms taking that into consideration it is definitely not a movie for mindless entertainment director john berry wisely does not attempt to dress-up athol fugard s play sure we re given a few fractured flashbacks and some breathtaking scenic shots but the film version of boesman and lena remains on the whole a story of two people living in inhumane conditions stripped of their basic human rights boesman glover and lena bassett have no one left to attack but each other a third character joins them for awhile willie jonah amazing in a largely silent role but the film s focus never strays from the title characters and what they ve become bassett and glover give brave performances as the broken couple performances that simply could not be improved upon vigorously and brutally stimulating both intellectually and emotionally boesman and lena deserves to be rediscovered of home video hands down the best film of the year 	POS
this was by far the best war documentary ever made from the very beginning of the first episode when sir laurence olivier described the horrific events in oradour-sur-glane the day the soldiers came to the final days of the war when the mushroom clouds appeared over japan i never missed a second of this classic series and i remember it well even though it was screened way back in each and every aspect of this tragedy was covered in detail this whole series should be compulsory viewing for as many of the world s children as possible so that the tragedy of world war two is not repeated and that bigotry hatred greed and intolerance are not confused with patriotism or religious zeal 	POS
the th animated disney classic is a reasonable movie told through a simple story even though a little dated it deserves a place in the list of disney classics it s not among disney s top works but is satisfying one of disney s most simple works yes but keeps a certain magic and enchantment which old disney is well known for this was an important movie because it saved disney from a delicate situation if this was a failure there wouldn t be any more disney animated classics cinderella is somehow like a return to disney s st animated classic snow white and the seven dwarfs because it brings back the fairy tale genre it s not clear where the story takes place but i suppose it s somewhere in france because this is based in a tale by charles perrault there are plenty of likable characters such as cinderella the prince bruno the dog jaques and gus the two main mice the fairy godmother for a fairy she sure is funny the birds the king and the grand duke jaques is very smart and amusing i love his voice really has that mouse-like quality gus might not be that smart but he s humorous the king is hilarious but i think that what makes him so funny is his short temper the grand duke is a very cool chap and funny too they re two of my favorite characters in this film and responsible for many of the most amusing moments the prince is certainly one of the most charming in disney no doubt that prince philip from sleeping beauty was inspired on this prince because they are very similar-looking on the other hand lady tremaine the stepmother isn t supposed to be likable because she s cold jealous bitter and cruel her daughters anastacia and drizella aren t much better than her however the stepmother isn t as annoying as her ugly and selfish daughters cinderella the main character has nothing to do with them cinderella is gentle kind pretty and lovable by the way i think her beautiful pink dress is much nicer than the one given by the fairy godmother lucifer the cat is hilariously malicious the way he walks sticking up his nose in the air and those arrogant and snobbish facial expressions make him funny ironically he s very much like the stepmother when it comes to personality he always agrees with the stepmother s attitudes towards cinderella lucifer has the right name for him because he s such a devilish and mean cat yet there s nothing annoying about him the soundtrack is simple but pleasant although not among disney s best the best song in this movie is bibiddi bobiddi boo there are plenty of well known talented voice actors in this such as james macdonald marion darlington eleanor audley verna felton and luis van rooten despite being simple-looking the movie has good artwork as well as its nice details although never something out-of-this-world however the king s palace is a spectacular masterpiece being truly majestic and colossal 	POS
the main reason to see this film is warren william who is in top form as the shyster campaign manager he is electric constantly finding ways to fool the public and defeat the opposing party in the midst of the biggest disasters william is a great actor -- i feel he never got his due bette davis as his girlfriend also shines in an under-written role personally i found guy kibbee not quite right as the lame-brained candidate that william and the others are trying to foist on the public he seemed more like an empty canvas than a person i would have preferred to see a real character emerge rather than a non-character the story itself is implausible silly and clichéd but warren william and bette davis are well worth watching 	POS
 read my lips sur mes lèvres which probably has different idiomatic resonance in its french title is a nifty twisty contemporary tale of office politics that unexpectedly becomes a crime caper as the unusually matched characters slide up and down an ethical and sensual slippery slope the two leads are magnetic emmanuelle devos who i ve never seen before despite her lengthy resume in french movies and an even more disheveled than usual vincent cassel who has brought a sexy and or threatening look and voice to some us movies the first half of the movie is on her turf in a competitive real estate office and he s the neophyte the second half is on his turf as an ex-con and her wrenching adaptation to that milieu writer director jacques audiard very cleverly uses the woman s isolating hearing disability as an entrée for us into her perceptions turning the sound up and down for us to hear as she does so it s even more annoying than usual when audience members talk using visuals as sensory reactors as well none of the characters act as anticipated she is not like that pliable victim from in the company of men not in individual interactions not in scenes and not in the overall arc of the unpredictable story line well until the last shot but heck the audience was waiting for that fulfillment as we move from a hectic modern office to a hectic disco to romantic and criminal stake-outs there is a side story that s thematically redundant and unnecessary but that just gives us a few minutes to catch our breaths this is one of my favorites of the year originally written 	POS

an old man works as a janitor in a mental hospital to be close to his wife who is a patient there and to try to get her out this is surely one of the most forgotten masterpieces of the silent era and an oddity in the history of japanese cinema long thought lost a print was found in the s and a music soundtrack added to it which fits perfectly with the images it might have been influenced by cabinet of doctor caligary director kinugasa claimed he never saw the german film however it surpasses it in style and in its more convincing and chilly portray of the inner mental state of the inmates in the asylum to achieve this the film makes use of every single film technique available at the time: multiple exposures and out of focus subjective point of view tilted camera angles fast and slow motion expressionist lighting and superimpositions among others it is also a very complicated film to follow as it has not got intertitles the film opens with a montage of shots of rain hitting the windows of the hospital wind shaking trees and of thunder the unsettling weather metaphors the mental condition of the patients and introduces one of the them: a former dancer the combination of sounds produced by rain wind and thunder serves as the music that incites the dancer to get into a frantic almost hypnotic dance in another sequence involving the same patient engaged in another frenzied dance she is being watched by other inmates multiple exposures of the dancer represent the patients point of view and their confused view of the world these are just two examples from this amazing film trying to represent the patients subconscious and view of the sane world in three words a must see 	POS

first of all i think the below comment is unworthy for a site like this obviously you have no taste and you don t respect the taste of others not to give you a history lesson but i think it needs to be done black actors out there are just if not more successful as others if you are not a part of the black race you cannot understand the quality creativeness and vibrant of old movies such as sparkle and mahogany and cooley high since unfortunately you are not black you do not have the pleasure of feeling what we feel when we watch these classics so therefore you need to keep your freaking mouth shut and just stick to your non-dancing race thanks 	POS
this is a must see for independant movie fans but it also holds up well against mainstream movies i think we have the makings of the next woody allen ortrentin tarrentino here the budget is painfully low no special effects whatsoever and they seemingly used ambient lighting shot in digital video -and yet this movie grabs hold of you and never lets go the screenplay is somewhat bizarre yet the actors and director pull it off with complete realism it has humor it has intrigue and it has pathos and it all works together no point in describing the details if you want to see an independantmasterpiece a virtual lesson in how to make a low budget flick that really works see this one -oh yeah it s also really entertaining 	POS
with twelve monkeys you need to pay attention but if you do that you probably find a lot to appreciate i know i did the story is interesting and deals with time traveling a virus killed a lot of people back in and a guy named cole bruce willis is send back to and to find a cure for the virus in he is arrested and put in a mental hospital there he meets jeffrey goines brad pitt who probably has something to do with the virus he also meets psychiatrist dr kathryn railly madeleine stowe who doesn t believe him in when cole disappears from the mental hospital while he is chained and locked in a room and re-appears in kathryn starts believing cole s stories the movie constantly plays with time cole makes a phone call and leaves a message in it is picked up in the future and they send someone for cole that someone appears only seconds after the phone call things like this happen throughout the movie and therefore you must keep attention you could ask some questions but since you can t have an answer yourself it is better to agree with the movie twelve monkeys works as sci-fi with some great images and a dark atmosphere and it works as a thriller you are never certain of what will happen next and that helps the movie may be it has some flaws in the story but since it is about a fictional thing like time traveling you should accept what the movie tells us and just try to enjoy that was the easy part for me 	POS

this interesting giallo boosts a typical but still thrilling plot and a really sadistic killer that obviously likes to hunt his victims down before murdering them in gory ways directed by emilio p miraglia who one year earlier also made the very interesting la notte che evelyn usci della tomba see also my comment on that one the film starts off a little slow but all in all no time is wasted with unnecessary sub plots or sequences this film is a german-italian coproduction but it was released in germany on video only in a version trimmed by minutes of plot under the stupid title horror house at least the murder scenes which will satisfy every gorehound are fully intact and the viewer still gets the killer s motive at the end but the italian version containing all the footage is still the one to look for of course a convincing giallo with obligatory twists and red herrings la dama rossa uccide sette volte is highly recommended to giallo fans and slightly superior to miraglia s above mentioned other thriller

okay yes this was a very-tight-budget movie with continuity errors like single scenes obviously filmed in sunshine and then in shadow and then mixed together and as much as i love nick mancuso he was often a little too good at the burnt-out part and some of the minor supporting cast was really bad plus at least one actor was used for two different but conspicuous roles but come on richard grieco was hysterical his hair alone is worth the trip steven ford was very likable mancuso had some great lines while nancy allen ironically was completely bland and uninteresting classic no bad parts yes entertaining big yes i would have loved to have been on-set the day they decided what kind of hairstyle grieco would have are you fast y ain t that fast 	POS
if you like cars you will love this film there are some superb actors in the film especially vinnie jones with his typical no nonsense attitude and hardcase appearance the others are not bad either there are only two slight flaws to this film firstly the poor plot however people don t watch this film for the plot secondly the glorification of grand theft auto car crime however if people really believe they can steal a ferrari and get away with it then good look to them hope you have a good time in jail when i first read that nicolas cage was to act the main role i first thought sweeet but then i thought naaaa you suck but then finally after watching the film i realised yep he suck s only joking he plays the role very well i ll end this unusual review by saying if the premature demise of a criminal has in some way enlightened the general cinema going audience as to the grim finish below the glossy veneer of criminal life and inspired them to change their ways then this death carries with it an inherent nobility and a supreme glory we should all be so fortunate you can say poor criminal i say: poor us p s - angelina jolie voight looks quite nice 	POS

the larger-than-life figures of wyatt earp and bat masterson and the specters of george armstrong custer and sitting bull loom over director anthony mann s hugely entertaining first western with james stewart although stewart s quest to avenge his father s murder is the primary story winchester is really an ensemble piece with the eponymous one-in-a-thousand firearm passing through the hands of many colorful owners including a wry trader john mcintire especially great and outlaw dan duryea who s even more despicable than usual the film s conflation of fiction and history produces a breezy pace and an ambivalent tone brilliantly in step with mann s pared-down compositionally rigorous film-making his themes of psychological unrest and past dictating present faintly underlie this tall tale of good and bad men chasing after a fabled gun but they starkly emerge in a vignette about a husband s cowardice and failed attempt at atonement and are defined in stewart s conversations with sidekick millard mitchell mann s use of environment is what sets him apart from other filmmakers of westerns instead of gazing at vistas from afar he incorporates them into the drama as characters that redirect complicate or evoke the human characters goals just as mountains caves and rapids had to be accounted for in the naked spur here a gunfight occurs amidst the loose rocks and boulders of a small mountain a physical obstruction that fatalistically determines the roles of victor and victim between two equally skilled sharpshooters i would be remiss in not recognizing cinematographer william h daniels s contribution particularly his superlative day-for-night open-range photography not merely an adept outdoorsman mann presents an equally vivid picture of wyatt earp-patrolled dodge city primarily through scaled multiple-plane staging the shooting contest does not depend on brisk camera shifts or twitchy cuts for effect because mann instinctively knows where to place the camera and how to move it to display the greatest density of information in a given shot nor does he care to spell out the plot in dialogue relying on the actors eyes or a well-chosen image to convey the stakes one scene in particular serves to explain his attitude: mitchell s telling of stewart s motivation to shelley winters which is interrupted by the climactic gunfight that soon enough reveals all light without feeling insubstantial intense without being overbearing winchester seems more modern than its contemporaries and is a joy to behold 	POS
i have never seen a barbara steele movie that i haven t liked and have always been a sucker for a good haunted-house story especially for such wonderful pictures as the legend of hell house and the original versions of the haunting and house on haunted hill so i had a feeling that castle of blood would be right up my alley and boy was it ever this french-italian coproduction while perhaps not the classic that steele s first horror film black sunday remains to this day is nevertheless an extremely atmospheric chilling entry in the spook genre filmed in black and white it manages to convey a genuinely creepy miasma the film concerns a journalist who bets one lord blackwood and an author named edgar allen poe that he can spend the night in blackwood s castle on the night of all saints day when the spirits of those killed in the castle reenact their fate the viewer gets to see these deaths and they are pretty horrible for the most part the film does indeed send shivers up the viewer s spine and in the uncut dvd that i just watched--thanks to the fine folks at synapse--even features a surprising topless scene and some mild lesbianism and barbara is wonderful in this movie; her otherworldly beauty is put to good advantage playing a sympathetic spectre her mere presence turns a creepy ghost story into something truly memorable not for nothing has she been called the queen of horror 	POS
i happened to see this movie twice or more and found it well made wwii had freshly ended and the so-called cold war was about to begin this movie could therefore be defined as one of the best propaganda patriotic movies preparing americans and secondly people from the still to be formed western nato block of countries to face the next coming menace the movie celebrates the might of the us through the centuries while projecting itself onwards to the then present war which had just ended nice and funny is the way of describing the discovering of the american continent by columbus and pretty the espisode of new amsterdam and the purchasing of manhattan from a drunk local indian must see it at least once for curiosity of fashion of propaganda through time : 	POS
simply put oliver is one of the greatest musicals of all time it is filled with memorable songs - food glorious food oliver consider yourself and oom-pah-pah to name just a few - and equally memorable characters the film is a musical adaptation of charles dickens classic novel and much like the story of oliver twist itself it is a perfect family film there are some frightening moments - the villain bill sykes played by oliver reed is scary enough on his own - but overall the film will appeal to children of all ages as well as adults the story - which almost everyone is surely familiar with by now - revolves around a little orphan boy named oliver and his life growing up in london at first he lives in the workhouse with the rest of his fellow orphans but after daring to question mr bumble the overseer he is sold to a family as a servant after a series of mishaps and close shaves he meets the artful dodger - superbly played by a young jack wild who gives his all in the role - and through him the greedy fagin ron moody who trains young boys to pick pocket treasures which he keeps for himself the film was shot solely in studios and on soundstages at shepperton film studios but this does not translate at all to film the sets perfectly replicate victorian london as do the costumes worn by the characters a multi-oscar winner and a massive success on its release oliver is a worthy contender for the best musical all of time and will delight anyone who loves film 	POS
where was this film when i was a kid after his parents split up tadashi moves with his mom to live his his grandfather tadashi s sister stays with their dad and they talk frequently on the phone grandfather is only here every third day moms never really home the kids always are picking on the poor kid during a village festival tadashi is chosen the kirin rider or spiritual champion of the peace and justice little does he suspect that soon he will have to actually step into role of hero as the forces of darkness join up with the rage of things discarded in a plot to destroy mankind and the spiritual world okay that was the easy part now comes the hard part trying to explain the film this is a great kids film no this is a great film flawed very flawed but a great film none the less it unfolds like all of those great books you loved as a kid and is just as dense at times as tadashi struggles to find the strength to become a hero watching it i felt i was reading a great book and thought how huge this would have been if it was a book i loved that the film does not follow a normal path things often happen out of happenstance or through miscommunication one character gets sucked into events simply because his foot falls asleep there are twists and turns and moments that seem like non sequiters and are all the more charming for it which is typical miike certainly its a takashi miike film that japanese master of film is clearly in charge of a film that often touching scary and funny all at the same time no one except miike seems to understand that you can have many emotions at the same time or that you can suddenly have twists as things get dark one second and then funny the next i admire the fact that miike has made a film that is bleak and hopeful that doesn t shy away from being scary i mean really scary especially for kids this is the same dark territory that should be in the harry potter movies but rarely is this a dark grimms tale with humor my first reaction upon seeing the opening image was that i couldn t believe anyone would begin a kids film with a picture of the end of the world then i realized who was making the movie hats off to miike for making a movie that knows kids can handle the frightening images its also operating on more than one level the mechanical monsters that the bad guys make are forged from mankind s discarded junk its the rage of being thrown away that fuels the monsters one of the yokai spirits talks about the rage sneakers thrown away because they are dirty or too small feels when they are tossed you also have one of the good guys refusing to join the bad guys because that would be the human thing to do its a wild concept but like other things floating around its what lifts this movie to another level there are a good many riffs and references to other movies tv shows and novels that make me wonder who this film is for since kids may not understand them though many parents will and of course there are the monsters they run the gamut from cheesy to spectacular with stops everywhere in between frankly you have to forgive the unevenness of their creation simply because they are has to be hundreds if not thousands of monsters on screen its way cool and it works one of the main characters is a yokai which i think is best described as a hamster in a tunic and is often played by a stuffed animal it looks dumb and yet you will be cheering the little bugger and loving every moment he rides on tadashi s head acceptance is also easier if you ve ever seen the old woodcuts of the weird japanese monsters i mentioned flaws and there are a few the effects are uneven some of the sudden turns are a bit odd even if understandable and a few other minor things which are fading now some two hours after watching the film none of them truly hurt the film over all however most kind of keep you from being completely happy with the movie i really loved this movie i m pretty sure that if i saw this as a kid it would have been my favorite film of all time where s the english dub see this movie its a great trip besides its a good introduction to the films of miike minus the blood and graphic sex 	POS
one is tempted to define the genre of gert de graaff s movie as `event of the thought following the example of merab mamardashvili the nominal storyline is a certain bart klever s torturous quest for that ephemeral substance which constitutes the essence of personality the script for his new movie is taking shape simultaneously on his computer and in his own imagination this film-monologue originated as a response to fellini s ` ½ and cost gert de graaff years of work excitedly playing with real and fictional characters as well as with the audience it reveals the whimsical interconnection of the real and imaginary the paradoxical co-existence in two different galaxies: that of guttenberg and that of maclhuen for some time we are apt to side with the script writer who believes that the cause of all misfortune is the damned stereotypes of mass mentality `man `catholic `window washer and together with him we fall into a trap when the author-creator is finally faced with the insoluble dilemma: how can one eliminate from the future movie bart klever just five minutes before the finale thanks to the common petty reproaches of the wife of the creator who is deeply immersed in work we realize that together with the main character we have again been `framed really what is the price of the art for the sake of which it is acceptable to renounce one s own name and the day-to-day care for the young daughter so who is he this bart klever is he a brilliant prophet or someone possessed like frenhoffer from balzac s masterpiece just like the latter the script writer in the end erases from the computer memory everything has written gert de graaff suggests that we answer this question ourselves 	POS
i enjoyed a lot watching this movie it has a great direction by the already know bigas luna born in spain and it is precisely in spain that the movie takes place in cataluña to be more precise luna explores once more the theme of an obcession in this case the obcession of a young boy for the women s milk there are some psychological concepts in this story such as the rejection complex that the elder son feels with the birth of his brother in the movie this is what leads to the obcession of the young boy who suddenly sees all his mother s milk go to the recently born son so he starts trying to find a breast who is able to feed him he finds it in a woman recently arrived and from here on the movie is all around this this movie lives a lot on imagery more than the story itself the espectator captures certain moments unforgettable moments and certain symbols the movie deserves a thourough analyses on almost everything that happens because it usually means something the surroundings the landscapes typical from the region as well as the surreal behaviors of the characters also symbolic and the excelent ambiguous soundtrack by nicola piovani transport us to another dimension not parallel to the real world but which intersects it from times to times worth living in that world worth watching this movie even though we may eventually and for moments get tired and a bit sick with the excessive obcession which is perhaps taken beyond the limits i also enjoyed the performance of the protagonist 	POS

although this was not without its faults this drama was a fitting one to be shown around easter time it reminded us of our spiritual selves and showed that behind our facades we often hide our deepest sufferings and experiences there was so much to enjoy in the drama not least the rapping teenagers who provided a better musical accompaniment to the drama than the rather poor sound score in the background the acting was excellent and timothy spall was once again superb the climax was very satisfying if rather simplistic timothy spall s letting go of his long-dead wife s suicide was credible and mirrored well the feelings of despair that were present in the teenage girl who self-harmed the resolution between the graffiti boy and the muslim was gratifying but less believable a wonderful drama which left myself and my husband felling that the evening had been well spent congratulations 	POS

this series could very well be the best britcom ever and that is saying a great deal considering the competitors fawlty towers good neighbours to name just two what made butterflies so superior even to the best of the best is that it did not just exemplify great classic classy and intelligent comedy but it also expanded horizons reflecting - flawlessly gently and at every detail - the great social change that was occurring in britain at the time i remember watching this show as a teenager and being in awe of everything about it the lifestyle depicted was remarkable in itself this was the first time i saw real people using cordless phones and the wardrobe of all the characters was far removed from the goofy seventies attire still seen in north america at the time then there were the decors shop fronts cars these people - even the layabout sons with their philosophical approach to life and epigrammatic humor - were sophisticated they were examples of the new europeans that would come to have an impact on life and style throughout the world in the coming decade s of course the premise was strange and fantastic the idea that someone who was living the suburban dream could be so discontent and restless was revolutionary particularly to north americans for whom happiness was always defined as money and things sure the situation was depicted in american movies and tv but not with the intensity of butterflies or the movie montenegro and if the premise was not surprising enough the means by which it was expressed took it to the extreme a potential affair that was not really about sex or even romance butterflies dazzled many but it must have left some people smacking their foreheads in disbelief at the time anyway butterflies turned out to be - in so many ways - prophetic it documented ahead of its time - post-modern ennui all-pervasive lifestyle the notion of emotional infidelity and generational disconnect and male discontent portrayed perfectly by the strained father-son relationships it is too bad this series has not been rediscovered in a big way and all those involved given credit for creating a meaningful snapshot of a certain time and place and foreseeing all the slickness and angst that was to come 	POS

 spoilers--careful what can i say i m biased when it comes to urban cowboy i love it and have watched it countless times--and usually find out something new about it with each viewing i think one of the things i like about it is that urban cowboy is about working class people not rich people who live in either l a or new york well it is true except for pam travolta plays bud a small town texas boy who moves to houston to work in the oil fields and this is when travolta actually played in good dramatic movies like saturday night fever instead of playing stereotypical bad guys good guys in big budget movies this is a really good movie--the mechanical bull riding contest and two-step dancing may be silly but you have to enjoy this for what it is bud meets sissy played by debra winger with slutty brilliance --and soon after they are married and living in their dream trailer but their relationship becomes a real life battle of the sexes bud wants to be a real cowboy sissy wants to be with a real cowboy but in modern times men s roles are not as clear where can bud prove he s a real man he can work his dangerous job by day and ride the mechanical bull by night--he can be a urban cowboy but sissy wants to drive his pick-up truck and she wants to ride the mechanical bull too so where does this leave bud as sissy asserts her independence she lies about riding the bull and flirts with the ex-con and prison rodeo star--a real bull rider-- wes played wonderfully greasy by scott glenn bud is threatened and bud and sissy break up sissy shacks up with wes who abuses her emasculating himself further bud becomes the boy toy of pam a rich girl whose daddy is in oil and all that implies sissy comes by the trailer to clean it up--pam doesn t do that kind of thing she writes a make up letter to bud but evil pam tears it up and takes the credit for sissy s housework bud s uncle bob dies tragically at work when lightening strikes and causes an explosion bud and sissy have a chance at reconciliation but are too stubborn later the mechanical bull riding competition is at gilley s and you know bud is going to win pam realizes that bud doesn t love her but sissy--he did it for her wes tries to rob gilleys but wouldn t you know that urban cowboy bud saves the day and wins back the woman he loves of course you may ask yourself why bud and sissy would go to gilleys about every night and live like pigs maybe that contributed to their bad marriage or why didn t bud stay with pam--she wasn t that bad and had money or why they had to kill off uncle bob or why bud and sissy had such stupid friends like marshall and jessie who were always trying to break them up: marshall says to bud she {sissy} rides that bull better than you do but part of the fun of urban cowboy is making fun of it a little bit--and saying isn t that bonnie raitt on the stage 	POS

this movie is an exact copy of a tv series on indian television channel doordarshan which was aired at least years ago the series was known as gubbarre meaning balloons each episode was a new short story the story is excellent and the original is much sweeter and convincing abhay doel does a good job but he doesn t fit the role of a normal and third class guys as he calls himself in the movie in fact shayan munshi with his hair cut short and without the designer clothes would have fitted the abhays role but shayan just doesn t have the talent to pull it off i would suggest watching the series if it is available it is the same story except for the running around with the friends mother and the initial introduction the acting of the tv actors was much better than these stars the only reason this movies is a flop is because the director tried to stretch half an hour or minutes story to + hours so it has to get draggy even the nasal singing sensations songs could not make up this movies is good for a lazy sunday afternoon and is really refreshing if you haven t watched the original tv serial the script and the ending of the serial was much better#####spoilers ahead######### #####spoilers ahead######### #####spoilers ahead######### #####spoilers ahead######### #####spoilers ahead######### the ending of the original serial was much stronger as the hero himself dumps the girl even thought she is willing to marry him he is aware and tell her that he doesn t want to be repayed and never helped with that intention the director or the script writes somehow could not capture the original ending in this film the original ending would have bought tears to the girls eyes and would have had the guys nodding in agreement the deliver just wasn t right but personally i feel this is a pathetic copy no credit should be given to the director scriptwriter the story is amazing and is by one of the famous novel writers int he class of premchand munshi i am not sure if this is premchand munshi s story but many of the other short stories int he series feature a few of premchand munshi s and other great hindi writers stories 	POS
 this is not a love song is a brilliant example of the chase genre which many people think has an underlying meaning the love between the two main characters may be more than fraternal i believe that heaton is in love with spike but spike is too naive to see this i really feel this is portrayed with such scenes as the blow back and letter writing sequences heaton shows great intimacy towards spike with intense facial expressions and how he takes great care in writing spike s name on the top of his letters one thing i ve noticed when looking at external reviews is that when the film has been slated the reviewer seems to have not fully understood the film as they haven t even mentioned the possibility of heaton having sexual feelings for spike i also get the feeling that some of the reviewers haven t recognised it when they use phrases like: who is heaton what s he doing with a retard like spike this person however may have hit the nail on the head with their remark spike shows noticeable signs of having a d d although i don t think this person has realised this as he seems to be using the word retard as a derogatory term i really enjoyed this film although it is not for the faint hearted the film is exceedingly character based after the shooting until the end there isn t much but dialogue between the two anti-heroes unless you are used to watching such deep gritty films stay well away 	POS
greetings again from the darkness directors of seemingly unrelated vignettes about love in the city of lights a very unusual format that takes a couple of segments to adjust to as a viewer we are so accustomed to character development over a hour movie it is a bit disarming for that to occur in an minute segment the idea is love relationship stories in different neighborhoods of this magnificent city of course some stand up better than others and some go for comedy while others focus on dramatic emotion some very known directors are involved including: the coen brothers wes craven alfonso cuaron alexander payne gus van sant and gurinda chadha many familiar faces make appearances as well: steve buscemi barbet schroeder catalina sandino moreno ben gazzara gena rowlands gerard depardieu juliette binoche willem dafoe nick nolte maggie gyllenhaal and bob hoskins one of the best segments involves a mime and then another mime and the nerdy yet happy young son of the two mimes also playing key roles are a red trench coat cancer divorce sexual fantasy the death of a child and many other topics don t miss alexander payne director of sideways as oscar wilde the diversity of the segments make this interesting to watch but as a film it cannot be termed great still it is very watchable and a nice change of pace for the frequent movie goer 	POS
with the sun shining brilliantly on a quiet sunday that is just about to fully wake up love can be felt in the soft breeze that sweeps past my feet and can be seen in the smiles of the people i walk alongside it is the perfect day to stop off for croissants and a café-o-lait before heading off to the city of lights and love of course a flight to paris is not reasonably in this humble film critic s budget so i had to opt for the next best thing paris je t aime a collection of short films by a variety of international directors each piece is named after a different parisian neighborhood and is a reflection on love careful not to over glorify the most powerful and persuasive of all human emotions paris je t aime explores love at the many stages of its own game the results are spontaneously romantic and surprisingly consistent and truly what better way to express the fleeting nature of love and how a moment can change your life than with a collection of filmed moments the beautifully poetic quote above is taken from tom tykwer s faubourg saint denis true to form tykwer run lola run uses time-lapse photography and repetition to demonstrate the entire cycle of love from inception to dissolution originally shot in and paired down for this anthology faubourg stars natalie portman as francine an american actress in paris for a part in a film and melchior beslon as thomas a blind man she falls in love with here the blind leads the blind through the most unstable of terrain where two people consume each other to a point where their lives nearly lose their own existences as love seems to go from dazzling to dizzying tykwer reminds us of the tricks it can play on our minds and the illusions it can create when we stray towards doubt perhaps the most giddily romantic offering comes from sylvain chomet s tour eiffel choosing the city s most identifiable attraction for its title chomet les triplettes de belleville gives us a little boy who tells the story of how his parents

the love of his life yolande moreau miming has become something of a dying art if it isn t already dead yet by nature it is dreamy and untroubled miming points its silent finger at the ridiculousness of human behaviour and what but love can make people act more absurd we might find someone special in the least likely of circumstances if we could just take ourselves a little less seriously paris je t aime keeps the flow lively by not always focusing on love between lovers three memorable shorts focus on the love between a parent and a child walter salles motorcycle diaries has catalina sandino

itself the characters that appear but fleetingly in paris je t aime find themselves at the romantic center of the universe the moments they share with each other be it helping someone up after a hard fall or reaching out your hand to another person without touching them or without their knowledge are the moments that give love its flare and flourish outside the city of lovers it can be easy to miss moments such as these but we must remind ourselves of their significance it takes but a moment for love to shine through a cloudy sky you just have to keep your heart open to see it and if one city can be so abundant with love one has to believe it can find its way one day to your door 	POS
overall this movie was excellent for its time and will be interesting for many more generations to come although the plot is not % accurate to the book most everything is correct the movie does skip far ahead and does miss some important parts i found the book and ready and immediately wished that they had made a movie because i hadn t found out about the movie yet but later i found the movie in a bargain bin at wal-mart and decided to buy it and see if it was what i had expected overall i give this movies a out of for its good parts relative accuracy and overall making sense and for its bad parts large time skips and small but noticeable inaccuracies 	POS

the first and second seasons started off shakily with good episodes sandwiched in between average ones and at times resorting to clichéd stories but once it started to set up the universe in which it exists and started to develop it s characters more it became a lot more fun and entertaining the main reason this show succeeds it because of four men: richard dean anderson peter deluise joseph malozzie and paul mullie richard s dry sense of humour makes to show so much better peter s directing is excellent and makes any episode so much more entertaining and joe & paul never fail to make a funny interesting episode together once you understand what the show is about and get to know the characters i doubt you won t like the show for those getting into the show i suggest the episodes the other side a good serious episode and window of opportunity a classic comic relief episode 	POS

as jack nicholson s directorial debut drive he said displays at the least that he is a gifted director of actors even when the story might seem to lose its way to the audience and to a modern audience - if they can find it which pops up now and again on ebay - it might seem more free formed than they think the film contains vivid interesting characterizations the film tells of two college kids: the protagonist is hector william tepper in what borders on a break-out performance a star of the leopards the college basketball team he plays on while he has to deal with a coach bruce dern who puts on the pressure to stay focused and a on and off girlfriend karen black with her own emotional problems there s gabriel michael margotta the other kid gabriel it seems is just a little more than freaked out by the possibility to be drafted and so in his own radical mind-state he does what he can to keep out but as hector tries to find the balance between his oncoming fame and those he loves gabriel is going over the threshold of sanity nicholson on the technical side of things displays a fascinating editing style that keeps things on edge during the basketball scenes and implements darkness in many other scenes with a documentary-feel throughout and from tepper black and even robert towne writer of chinatown last detail and mission: impossible among others who rarely acts he garners some credible acting work though in tepper there is a tendency to downplay his emotions in some scenes for example when he could act brilliantly sarcastic he doesn t play it for what it s worth from margotta on the other hand there is a vibrant twisted force in his performance and as he descends it s frightening but perhaps understandable from the times and what a climax dern steals most of his scenes by the way in a performance that should have garnered him an oscar nomination every line of his dialog is appropriate true and it s never hammed up like in recent coach movie performances but what drags down the film is that elements involving the characters aren t explained to the degree one might wish more the film was based on a novel by jeremy larner who co-wrote the script with nicholson and i was expecting that the film to be longer than it was it s a slim volume with a lot of information about the times about the sport about the underlying feelings that were with those of the younger generation nicholson presents us with these characters and situations and rarely are they shown to what s motivating them the anti-war protesters not included their part s understandable enough gabriel is perturbed by what s going on in vietnam but what else is there hector too is a guy who has apprehensions about being drafted for the nba and he still loves to play but what s holding him back this whole atmosphere is intriguing how the late s college basketball experience was but that intriguing quality which does lead to some unconventionality is kept at a point where it can t go too further overall the effect of the film as a whole is bittersweet and somewhat memorable for its good points and not for it s low ones and for sure you can tell who s behind the lens every step of the way b+	POS

oh those sneaky italians it s not the first time they based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the in this case author of the novel of course this is not something that is typically italian but got done quite a lot in the early days of cinema mostly because they often thought they would be able to get away with it james m cain s publishers managed to keep this movie off american screens until but nevertheless the movie itself has grown a bit into a well known classic the movie is not as great to watch as the american version but it s a great movie nevertheless this of course not in the least is due to the movie it s great strong story that is an intriguing one and provides the movie with some great characters and realism it follows the novel quite closely and is therefore mostly the same as other movie versions of its story with of course as a difference that it got set in an italian environment leave it up to the italians to make a movie about life and the real people in it these early drama s always have a very realistic feeling over it and are therefore also quite involving to watch unfortunately the movie lost some of its power toward the end when the movie started to feel a bit overlong and dragging in parts the movie could had easily ended minutes earlier nevertheless i don t really have much else negative to say about this movie it s simply a greatly made one based on some equally great and strong source material quite an impressive directorial debut for luchino visconti who continued to direct some many more great and memorable italian dramatic movies 	POS
this movie has to be my favorite of all time its not supposed to have a plot because its makers wanted people charlie sheen i think to believe it was a real snuff film this was an exercise in visual effects and doesn t cut away when the action happens like every other film does movies these days are now all about sound effects leaving the visuals to be made by computers cause its easier to deal with cgi blood there still are movie makers who still can t get fake blood to look like the real thing there is no rape scene because that wasn t the point of making the film have you seen the hills have eyes the rape scene was funny instead of shocking although i m sure there are some gonzo porn film makers that have tried to marry porn with horror but since they probably suck at making films they probably wouldn t be able to pull it off the movie baise moi has a disturbing rape scene because the actresses are actually porn stars and they show everything even though the movie overall sucks its too bad that a movie can t be made without thinking of the money aspect of it all especially when talking about an ao or nc- rating i m sure eli roth has the ability talent to make his hostel film series much much better but he has too tame it down to get an r rating or at least i hope that his movies sucked because of these limitations watch traces of death or more than smashed pumpkins if you want no frills real footage accident & crime scenes footage don t forget that this movie was made in the fact that this film can still stand up against most crap made these days says a lot about this film that would be like someone saying the bit super mario brothers sucks because the ps has better graphics 	POS

this was a very thought provoking film especially for at the time it was actually a huge box office success after the s it appeared to be forgotten but its central messages were too important to disappear completely it was actually at least fifteen years ahead of its time no one had ever heard of the greenhouse effect before and the controversial subject of euthanasia was rarely brought up the sets and special effects might look a little outdated but big money for sci fi films was a gamble in that period if you look closely you will see everything usually makes sense this is a message movie not for zonked out star wars fans that cant sit through one minute of thought stimulation unless it contains a million bucks worth of explosions this was also hestons last good film the end of his famous dystopian sci fi trilogy after that it was all overblown disaster epics and big budget crowd pleasing trash this might not be the most amusing two hour movie ever made and the ending might be creepy and depressing but its hard to find any film producer with guts anymore who would tackle a subject like this 	POS

there s more to offer in the opening of the odd couple than in the entirety of most films felix unger the poor guy s monogram even curses him checks into a new york hotel a cleaning lady says good night goodbye he answers back in his room he empties his pockets then struggles to take off his wedding ring only to put the objects neatly into an envelope addressed to his wife and beloved children when the viewer finally puts it together  aha he s going to off himself  we watch him struggle to open the window  oh no he s going to jump  the poor guy injures his lower back this is all you need to know about felix unger  his wife has left him he s a compulsive cleaner and he s a hypochondriac and all in one scene this is the particular genius of neil simon s comedy  it s about situation and character there are few obvious physical jokes  no kicks to the groin no cheap gags  just funny characters in uncomfortable situations and of course he is a master of manipulating the audience s expectations coming from the swingers era imagine what i thought in the date scene when felix starts lamenting about the breakup of his marriage to the girls his roommate oscar has worked so hard to get into his apartment he s blowing it right think again the girls love his sensitivity his ability to cry in front of them they invite him back to their place since his meatloaf has burned because oscar wasn t paying enough attention to it he s in like flynn right uh yes but he doesn t want to go with the girls because he s feeling vulnerable great stuff and it s made even greater with a style that minimizes editing and maximizes the wonderful eight-room apartment set you ve got jack lemmon and the slouchy pouchy walter matthau for chrissakes why mess it up the visual style reminded me of breakfast at tiffany s in that great effect is made from a large depth of field and the interplay between the various planes of action particularly memorable is the scene in which felix fleeing from oscar closes a partition only to realize the partition doesn t cover the side where oscar is coming from you get a real sense of the layout of the apartment and thus the proximity in which the two divorcées live the twist here is that these two are really married  to each other so the observations about married life that might be ignored in an ordinary romantic comedy are made all the more poignant since they are two guys 	POS
a recent viewing of that s entertainment has given me the urge to watch many of the classic mgm musicals from the forties and fifties anchors aweigh is certainly a lesser film than on the town the songs aren t as good nor is the chemistry between the characters but the film beautifully interweaves classical favorites such as tchaikovsky and the scene at the hollywood bowl with sinatra and kelly emerging from the woods above it at the top and then running down the steps while dozens of pianists play on the piano is the best scene in the film even though the scene in which kelly dances with jerry mouse is more famous classical music enthusiasts will no doubt identify the music the pianists are playing sinatra then croons i fall in love too easily before having his epiphany about whom he loves the color is beautiful hollywood looks pretty with its mountains and pollution-free air can you imagine hollywood in the twenties let alone the mid- s and the piano music is absolutely glorious mgm certainly had a flair for creating lyrical moments like these 	POS

the past few months i have collected voyager seasons to on dvd i only had to on video before that because kes is my favourite character and have just reached the end i saw them when they were originally shown on tv here in the uk but had forgotten most of it am i satisfied with the ending i think i am naturally as i fan i would have liked to have seen more about what happened to the characters when they got home but that s left to our imagination in many ways endgame is similar to next gen s all good things the involvement of the crew in the future but mainly the captain a new romance starting in the finale troi and worf in next gen and seven of nine and chakotay here which results in death in the future i truly loved endgame fair to all characters neelix appears although he left the ship two episodes earlier b elanna gives birth to her daughter with loving husband tom tuvok is ill but returning home means he can be cured harry has always been the most anxious and determined but admits the journey is important the doctor in the future is well respected by all and finally chooses the name joe but of course the captain has the largest role meeting her future self who wants to get the crew home earlier to prevent casualties the borg are involved as they have played a massive part in this period of voyager alice krige plays the borg queen again fantastically just her voice and acting method are magnificent i feel sorry for susanna thompson though the tv borg queen replaced by the movie borg queen maybe she wasn t available though the special effects are fantastic the borg sub space hub and the borg queen falling apart it s very tense especially when they come out of the borg subspace corridor and say their location is right where they thought they d be after they d said they d have to go in a corridor that leads back to the delta quadrant and what a wonderful idea to get inside a borg sphere for protection on the dvd special features they say it was like the trojan horse voyager could have continued if it was more popular they would have stuck with their original idea of the crew realising the ship is their home like in harry s speech and what tom said because his wife and child are there and then they could have got home in a film overall voyager was a bit hit and miss the sixth season seemed to be one good one followed by one less than good one the two episodes set in the holographic irish village are horrible my perception of seven of nine was that she took over it all revolved around her which wasn t true when she first appeared season was focused on her for too many of the episodes but it evened out after that and her character is ingenious at times years as a borg drone gradually rediscovering her humanity i like her especially in someone to watch over me imperfection and human error when naomi wildman was scared of her initially but then became her friend often by her side that was lovely chakotay became my least favourite character gone was the chemistry with janeway will they won t they and you d never think he was first officer he s completely pushed aside most of the time i loved seeing tom and b elanna s relationship blossom against the odds i always liked neelix a lot tuvok was good at times especially when he lost his logic gained emotion and was friends with neelix harry was annoying at times but a okay character at other times the doctor is probably my favourite seeing how far he comes and comedy situations he creates tinker tenor doctor spy is fantastic janeway is my favourite captain of any series and you can tell kate mulgrew is really enjoying it i wish there was more i love voyager 	POS
here is the example of a film that was not well received when it was made but whose standing seems to be raising in time the tenant is quite an interesting work by polanski one of the first of his european exile it is set in paris and as in so many other exile films the city its streets the seine and especially the building where the action takes place play an important role it is just that polanski chooses his principal character not to be an american as in frantic for example but a pole as himself was when going west there is actually a lot of personal commentary in this film made at what must have been a time of crisis in the director s life and the fact that he decided to play the lead role and does it masterfully may also be seen as some kind of exorcism it s in a way a circular story the hero named trelkovsky rents an apartment in old parisian building inhabited by what seem to be first a well assorted team of grumpy old or just ridiculous neighbors the previous tenant tried to commit suicide by jumping out of the window of the flat and trelkovsky has just the time to visit her in the hospital before she dies and meet there her young and beautiful friend stella a spectacled isabelle adjani in her first role after truffaut s l histoire d adele h soon the neighbors do not seem to be what they are it s a conspiracy to make him crazy or to make him enter the life and role of the dead girl he fights tries to run enters the game and ends by entering the circle and slowly becoming her the circle is closed it s not the most believable story we may have seen or heard but the strength of the film does not reside in the story but in the details of the psychology in the slow degradation of the mental state of the hero in the permanent balancing game between reality and delusion to a certain extent it is not what happens on the screen that matters but how it happens reminding the classical knife in the water made more than a decade before at the end of the polish period of polanski there are many details that are never explained but then this is how mystery films must be and this is actually how life is sometimes the feeling of claustrophobia slowly contaminates the viewer unfortunately some of the graphical details in the last part of the film are not too well executed and the english spoken dialogs the film was made in english almost neutralize the overall atmosphere however waiting for the final punch scene is very worth the patience it s not the best film that polanski made yet has many good parts it shows the hand and the style of the director and was a significant step in the building of his career 	POS
it is fitting on a musical sunday to get your heart a pumping and no one can do that better than little richard the man could sing the drawers off the ladies and defined rock and roll look to leon to provide a definitive characterization as he has done so with david ruffin in the temptations and jackie wilson in mr rock n roll: the alan freed story this was a fascinating biopic as we saw little richard struggle with his father with his church and with himself over just who he was he won the battle and there is no one else that has his voice or his style 	POS
in the same vein as natural born killers another movie that was not so popular with critics because of its excessive violence but that i also loved kalifornia is a movie that clearly glamorizes violence but i like to think that it turns that around in the final act kind of like how the basketball diaries glamorizes drugs at first but shows the bad side by the end of the movie which is far worse than the good side is good david duchovny plays brian kessler an artistic yuppie with an even more artistically yuppie girlfriend who is into that violent sexy black and white photography generally reserved for i don t know where places where nudity passes for art maybe it really does and i just don t understand it at any rate brian and carrie duchovny and michelle forbes who fits the role flawlessly make the perfect couple to go on a documentary tour of famous murder sites brian the writer will write the book carrie can take the pictures being artistic types brian and carrie are not quite financially prepared for such a trip so they put out an ad for someone to share gas and travel expenses and are contacted by early grace and adele corners brad pitt and juliette lewis early is on parole and assigned to janitorial work at the local university by his parole officer sees the ad on a bulletin board and decides to leave the state for a while violating his parole but also leaving the scene of his landlord s murder so he won t have to deal with a pesky murder investigation two birds with one stone you know the movie has a curious ability to portray two stereotypes the artsy yuppies and the greasy trailer trash without resorting to clichés or even ending up with caricatures of either type brian and carrie are artsy liberals but while carrie catches on to early and adele brian is fascinated with early s status as an outlaw as seen in the scene where brian shoots early s gun never having fired a gun before he s as fascinated as a little kid while adele and carrie are back at a hotel and adele reveals such things in her childlike way as the fact that early broke her of smoking and that she s not allowed to drink early doesn t think women should early and brian are out at the local bar brian reacts nervously to a drunk trying to start a fight with him and early first gives advice to brian on what to do and then steps in and dishes out a quick lesson for the guy hit him bri it s comin this is one of my favorite scenes in the movie partly because it s so funny what early gleefully says as the guy s friends drag him away bloodied and battered but also because as it is intercut with the girls back at the hotel we learn so much all at once about the two couples their differences and the conflicts that are likely to come up because of them and besides that because brian benefited from early s actions and carrie is appalled by what she hears from adele it also illustrates the different way that carrie and brian react to early and adele clearly by now you can tell that this is not your typical odd couple type of thriller where the city folk run into the country folk and all sorts of stereotypical mayhem ensues on one hand it seems a little too convenient that brian and carrie go on a tour of murder sites and just happen to be accompanied by a real life murderer but on the other hand it s a great way to counteract the glorifying of murder that is inherent within a cross-country trip designed to bring fame to murderers and their crimes while studying the actions of past murderers brian and carrie ultimately find themselves face to face with the very material that they are studying and realize that murder is not as pretty or morbidly fascinating when it s in your face as it is through disconnected studies of murders past i am constantly amazed at brad pitt s versatility as an actor consider for example his roles in movies like kalifornia monkeys fight club and ocean s and pitt is like tom hanks in that he can change his appearance drastically or just enough to fit a given character and is completely believable incidentally i tried in vain to be early grace for halloween this year but just couldn t get the hair and beard right i even got the hat right which initially i thought would be the hardest part it s easy to understand why a lot of people disliked kalifornia or why they think that it glorifies violence and murder but i think that whatever glorifying it does is done with the intention of clarifying the audience s understanding of its subject matter a film that didn t glorify violence at least initially could never be as effective as kalifornia but the movie structures it perfectly the glorification is all embodied in brian s and carrie s fascination with the idea of murder and the auras of the places in which is happened but their realization and ours is embodied in the real thing which they encounter with early and adele the movie s very purpose is to describe that difference between idealizing violence and seeing the horror of it up close and for real 	POS
i enjoy all the versions of this story but this one is my all time favorite george c scott gives a depth to the scrooge character that the others do not give the movie shows more about why he becomes so bitter the changes in scrooge appear gradually as he encounters the different ghosts and the incidents that they show him this movie has the best tiny tim by far he is the right age rather than being played by someone who is almost a teenager as in the other films anthony walters still has all or most of his baby teeth david warner is wonderful as bob cratchit he is such a versatile actor he portrays a man who clearly loves his family he plays the role with dignity neither as a wimpy man cowering under scrooges thumb but as a man who gracefully puts up with it because he has a family to provide for susannah york and the other actors do a fine job of bringing the characters to life edward woodward is the best ghost of christmas present i ve ever seen most often he is played as a jolly santa type character in this he shows anger at scrooges attitudes and really makes scrooge reconsider the costumes and the sets really bring the london of dickens time to life a wonderful movie 	POS
i first saw this film during and international film studies course i am a non-traditional student and perhaps for reasons of years-lived or wisdom-accrued appreciated the slow reflective pacing of the film s narrative languorous with the heat and dust of an arid clime the story is deeply psychological replete with multi-layered symbolism and an articulate inversion of the theme of being the other in a land that one does not understand the understanding that does come is fraught with the unresolved memories and subjectivity of the outsider made nearly years ago it is also a forerunner in a genre of numerous other international films that explore the themes of colonials in colonized spaces clueless to the nuances of the cultures into which they have entered much more lavishly filmed---and heavily financed--- works that have been made since reflect the same themes: indochine nowhere in africa are two that in comparison perhaps make chocolat seem pale and boring it has no adrenaline-pumping action or extreme violence the struggles are mental emotional and subtle but that being said it is a fine film worth a viewing 	POS
dana andrews is one of those actors that i ve probably seen in a dozen films but who has never really registered for me often stolid taciturn playing the same kinds of roles and looking somewhat like the similarly underrated glenn ford he s an actor that takes some effort to really appreciate; but once you hit the right film and this is it preminger s moody look at new york s underbelly is as dirty and seedy as just about any s noir and andrews is in his element as too-tough cop mark dixon who just doesn t know how to play the game to get ahead: he hates criminals too much to always play by the rules early on in the film he accidentally kills the witness to a murder involving an illegal crap game set up by a mobster who dixon hates for personal reasons and he spends the rest of the film trying to cover up his involvement and bring the mobster to his kind of justice along the way he gets involved with the estranged wife of the man he killed gene tierney and also has to try to get her father off the hook for the murder stunningly photographed by joseph lashelle with hard and sparkling dialogue by ben hecht and a truly powerful ending with elements of tragedy and found grace in just a minute or two of time this is another noir for the ages and might be my favorite preminger film thus far -- it s every bit as good as the more-heralded laura 	POS

it s a strange thing to see a film where some scenes work rather weakly if only in comparison to other films in its legacy and others in a sub-plot or supporting story are surprisingly provocative and strong sudden impact is one of those cases where clint eastwood as star producer director shows when he can be at his best or at his lessor of times when dealing with a crime mystery detective story in his dirty harry fame we get that make my day line and un-like in the first film where his do i feel lucky speech was playful and cool the first time and the second time at the end tough as nails here it s switched around he gets into another shamble with the department as usual when he tries to fight crime his way in particular with a diner robbery inspiration for pulp fiction and with a high speed pursuit with a senior citizen bus he s told to take a vacation and that s the last thing on his mind this whole main plot isn t very convincing aside from the expectancy of the story and lines which just adds to the frustration but soon his story merges with the sub-plot that eastwood develops from the start enter sandra locke s character jennifer spencer whom we soon learn after some appropriately mysterious scenes that she and her shy sister were victims of a cruel unjust sexual assault err outright rape and is sleekly undercover-like getting revenge her scenes and story are the strongest parts of the film the most intense and finally when it goes into callahan s storyline he s getting facts in the same small town she s in on a murder the film finally finds a focus between eastwood s classic form of clearly defined good vs evil though sometimes blurred to be sure eastwood films the flashbacks not to say too much about them expertly in a fresh experimental style; the trademark lalo schifrin score is totally atmospheric in these scenes and in others it almost seems like a couple of times an art-house sensibility has crept into eastwood s firmly straightforward storytelling style which helps make the film watchable it s a shame though that in the end it goes more for the expectable or maybe not expectable points and until the third act callahan doesn t have much to do except his usual it s smith wesson and me shtick however with locke he gets out of her a very good performance more subtle and touching than the one in the gauntlet and an exciting climax at an amusement park in a way i do and don t agree with ebert s remark that it s like a music video in eastwood s style here i admit there is comparisons with the simplicity of both the directness but the scenes where eastwood does break form are superior to those of any music video it s cheesy it s hard-edged it s not up to par with the first two harry pictures but hey there could be worse ways to spend a couple hours with the master of the 	POS
the league of gentlemen is one of the funniest strangest darkest and most unforgettable comedies of our time so much so it paved the way for more comedies of its ilk many of which have copied the style but have never succeeded unlike every other sketch show around the characters of the league of gentlemen are all loosely connected firstly they all live in the fictional town of royston vasey in the back of beyond of northern england the first characters to greet newcomers are tubbs and edwrad the pig-faced owners of a supposedly local shop situated so far away most of the residents probably don t know of its existence other oddities include: the denton family with an obsession with hygiene chastity and toads; hillary briss who sells a special yet thankfully unknown brand of meat; pauline a restart officer with a sharp tongue and even sharper pens; mr chinnery kind-hearted vet and menace to all things four-legged; geoff tipps a plastics salesman with a vicious sense of humour often involving guns electric tubes and plums despite being a comedy at heart the league of gentlemen often transcends genres whilst never appearing to be spoofing or ripping off other people s material there are several horror references such as the disappearance of a hiker a pair of silent twins an obsessive circus owner and a sudden outbreak of nosebleeds even more striking are moments when the series takes on a more sobre tone and aforementioned characters such as pauline and geoff are shown in a more sympathetic vulnerable light the film adaptation is the best demonstration of this but some fans may decide they belong local the equally underrated third series also takes a different route instead of sketches each episode focuses on an individual character with each storyline leading to one conclusion involving a plastic bag and a runaway theatre company van although many fans may not enjoy the structure of the film or the third series as much as the first two they re certainly signs to how inventive the league of gentlemen can be and how unafraid to explore new areas in short the league of gentlemen is definitely worth a look as like the welcome signs says: you ll never leave 	POS

while a bit preachy on the topic of progress as the saving grace of mankind this is still a stunning film that presages the science-fiction special effects blockbusters that would take another years to arrive on the silver screen it predicts the global chaos of wwii but expands on the premise by having the conflict last years and then tells the epic tale of man s struggle out from under the rubble and into the wilds of space the acting seems wooden and strangely sterile but this is perhaps a result of its contrast with the visuals which must have been utterly breathtaking at the time of the movie s release and which still impress today this is a film not to be missed by anyone at all interested in the sf genre 	POS
i d read about flavia the heretic for many years but i only got to see it early last year when i went on an insane movie-buying binge and for whatever reason it has been on my mind lately though it s been some months since i watched it it s a striking film set in italy somewhere around the th century definitely medieval-era though i don t think any specific year is ever given this being the time of christian ascendancy the age is a time of utter madness and the movie captures this very well flavia our protagonist is a young lady who encounters a fallen muslim on a battlefield he seems a warm and intriguing fellow and she s immediately taken with him her father a soldier of a a family of some standing comes along almost immediately and murders the wounded man right before her eyes but she ll continue to see him in her dreams her father ships her off to a convent that seems more like an open-air insane asylum--the residents so harshly repressed by unyielding medieval christianity slowly go mad flavia comes under the influence of one of the nuttier nuns but in a mad world only the sane are truly mad and this sociopathic sister clearly recognizes the insanity around her her take on the times in which they live strikes a chord with flavia who being young and apparently sheltered is beginning to question everything about this world in which she finds herself trapped the movie is unflinching in its portrayal of that world showcasing a lot of unpleasantness we see a horse gelded a lord rape one of the women of his lands in a pig-sty the pious torture of a young nun through it all flavia observes and questions rejecting eventually the christian dogma that creates such a parade of horrors in terms that would gain the movie some criticism over the years for seeming anachronistic i disagree with that criticism flavia s views though sometimes expressed in ways that vaguely mirror for example then-contemporary feminist commentary the movie was made in revolve around what are really pretty obvious questions it is perhaps difficult to believe she could be so much of a fish out of water in her own time but that s the sort of minor point it doesn t do to belabor flavia is written in such a way to allow those of our era or of any era to empathize with her plight getting bogged down on such a matter would be missing the forest for the trees flavia is heartened when the muslims arrive invading the countryside and she finds in their leader a new version of the handsome islamist who still visits her dreams smitten with her almost immediately he allows her to virtually lead his army becoming a joan of arc figure in full battle-gear and directing the invaders to pull down christian society and wreak vengeance upon all those she s seen commit evil is she the herald of a new and better world she may think so but muslims of that era weren t big on feminism either as she soon learns the hard way as they say meet the new boss this is really just a thumbnail of some of the things that happen in flavia the heretic the movie is quite grim and with a very downbeat rather depressing ending not a mass-audience movie at all to be sure it s quite good though and doesn t belong on the nunsploitation pile on which it is often carelessly thrown i think there s much value in the final film and i m glad i saw it 	POS

in the beginning of this film one of the commentators says that he was told that he has two strikes against him: he is black and male but in addition to that he has a third strike: he s gay you re going to have to be stronger than you ever imagined he is told paris is burning is a documentary about gay black and hispanic men who are tranvestites or transsexuals the miracle of paris is burning is that director jennie livingston takes a subject that could have very easily become a freak show and allows the people in it their humanity we learn their views of homosexuality men women their hopes their disappointments their dreams some of these dreams are so unattainable it s tragic many of the people are seriously in denial;this is not a film for everyone there are shots in this movie of nude transsexuals if you have a problem with homosexuality then this movie isn t for you but if you do see this movie you ll realise paris is burning isn t really about men wearing women s clothes it s about a group of people who are routinely marginalised and put down by society at large and what they do to get a sense of community in their lives i ve watched this movie four times since it was released in because it says so many things: it s a commentary about materialism in our culture about gender roles about rich and poor people about the media and what it celebrates about fame and adulation paris is burning is one of the most humane and one of the saddest movies i ve ever seen 	POS

samuel fuller is hardly one of america s great directors i m not sure he qualifies as one of hollywood s great craftsmen but he certainly ranks up there with the best of hollywood s true professionals who were willing to march to their own music during the time he worked for hollywood studios he knew how to take an assignment shape the middling material handed to him and then turn it quickly and efficiently into something usually better than its parts on time and on budget pickup on south street is a case in point on the surface it s one more of hollywood s early fifties anti-commie movies complete with appeals to patriotism a hard-boiled hero and a slimy and copiously perspiring bad guy fuller turns this bag of hollywood clichés into a taut exciting drama with any number of off-kilter twists the hero skip mccoy is a three-time loser a petty crook with soft fingers who doesn t change his stripes until the very end the girl in the caper candy has a level of virtue that would be easy to step over if you re so inclined one of the most appealing characters moe williams is a stoolie and in an unusual approach to hollywood s battle against commies the appeals to patriotism fall on deaf ears; the hero isn t motivated by anything so ennobling he just wants payback for a personal reason and winds up becoming at least for now a good guy plus all the actors were mostly assigned to fuller by the studio he had to make do richard widmark by now had established his presence as an actor and star but jean peters is a surprise she gives a fine portrait of a woman sexy and dumb and no better than her boy friends or her clients want her to be and richard kiley who later would become a two- time tony award winning star on broadway is convincingly slippery and cowardly it s hard to remember that he was the actor who inflicted on us i mean introduced to us the impossible dream from man of la mancha more than anything else this tale of a pickpocket who picks a purse in a subway car and finds himself with microfilmed secrets instead of cash pursued by the feds and the commies moves straight ahead with great economy the whole enterprise with a classic noir look only takes minutes to tell the dialogue with fuller as screenwriter has that party corny partly pungent hard-boiled pulp fiction style that muffin you grifted she s okay one character says to skip about candy fuller moves us just fast enough from scene to scene to keep us hanging on what will come next then fuller throws in the character of moe williams all of a sudden the story ratchets up to a whole new level of interest part comedy relief and part sad inevitability the thing i like best about the movie is how the opening exemplifies fuller s talents and strengths in minutes and seconds starting right after the credits fuller is able to instantly power up the movie to establish for us what the story is about and to show us what kind of characters -- skip and candy -- we re going to be involved with and he does this with so much enticing curiosity in that hot packed subway car that we can just about feel fuller setting the hook to catch us says glenn erickson in my opinion one of the best of movie critics in what should be an inconsequential story sam fuller defines his peculiar view of americanism from the bottom up: stiff-necked aggressive self-interest that when fully expressed recognizes what s wrong and what s right and isn t afraid to fight for it as always in his work the individuals who fight the hardest for their country are the ones least likely to benefit from the effort he s right and it makes for a movie still vivid after years 	POS

first of all for this movie i just have one word: wow this is probably one of the best movies that touched me from it s story to it s performances so wonderfully played by sophia loren and marcello mastroianni i was very impressed with this last one because he really brought depth to the character as it was a very hard role still the two of them formed a pair that surprised me from the beginning until the end showing in the way a friendship filled with love that develops during the entire day settled in the movie the story takes some time to roll as the introduction of the characters is long but finally we are compensated with a wonderful tale about love and humanity if you have the chance see it because it s a movie that will stay in your mind for many time simply amazing - 	POS

this will be somewhat short first don t listen to the critics as it is not as bad as most say it is sniper uses a classic movie formula which many dismiss immediately as flawing the movie while sniper does not reflect the % truth about how our country s military snipers work it does give those who know nothing about the professional sniper a glimpse into the world of the sniper and yes the movie has many flaws but what movie doesn t there are many good scenes and good acting by tom berenger i have to say the worst scenes are at the beginning of the movie with billy zane in the helicopter followed by zane in the marine s bar scene the best scene in sniper is with berenger in the middle of a field with the opposing force sweeping it also there are plenty of good shots of the jungle and some classic shots using the camera as though you are looking through a riflescope and yes the sniper motto is `one shot one kill judge sniper for yourself 	POS

i thought rachel york was fantastic as lucy i have seen her in kiss me kate and victor victoria as well and in each of these performances she has developed very different and very real characterizations she is a chameleon who can play and sing anything i am very surprised at how many negative reviews appear here regarding rachel s performance in lucy even some bonafide tv and entertainment critics seem to have missed the point of her portrayal so many people have focused on the fact that rachel doesn t really look like lucy my response to that is so what i wasn t looking for a superficial impersonation of lucy i wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown and rachel certainly gave us that in great depth i also didn t want to see someone simply doing classic lucy routines therefore i was very pleased with the decision by the producers and director to have rachel portray lucy in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skits - vitameatavegamin and the candy factory it seems that some of the reviewers didn t realize that these two scenes were meant to be rehearsal sequences and not the actual skits this approach i thought gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know by heart i also thought rachel was terrifically fresh and funny in these scenes and she absolutely nailed the routines that were recreated - the professor and the grape stomping in particular there was one moment in the grape scene where the corner of rachel s mouth had the exact little upturn that i remember lucy having i couldn t believe she was able to capture that - and so naturally i wonder if many of the folks who criticized the performance were expecting to see the lucille ball of i love lucy throughout the entire movie after all those of us who came to know her only through tv would not have any idea what lucy was really like in her early movie years i think rachel showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant she planted all the right seeds for us to see the clown just waiting to emerge given the right set of circumstances lucy didn t fit the mold of the old studio system in her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era she kept repressing what would prove to be her ultimate gifts i believe that rachel deftly captured the comedy drama wit sadness anger passion love ambition loyalty sexiness self absorption childishness and stoicism all rolled into one complex american icon and she did it with an authenticity and freshness that was totally endearing lucy was a star turn for rachel york i hope it brings a flood of great roles her way in the future i also hope it brings her an emmy 	POS
over the years we ve seen a lot of preposterous things done by writers when the show just had to go on no matter what keeping simple rules going after john ritter died comes to mind but this is probably the first time i cared the idea of having that s show without eric or to a lesser extent kelso is ridiculous they tried to cover it up with a comeback of leo and increasingly outrageous story lines but it always felt like why bother when you don t have a main character anymore it just didn t really connect it was a bunch of unrelated stuff happening that most of the time wasn t even funny the last season felt like the season too much for every single character simply because eric used to take a lot of screen time and now we d be smashed in the face by how stale and repetitive the rest of the characters were focusing on the gimmick that is fez was thoroughly uninteresting and the character would simply stop working because the whole deal was that he d say something weird from out of nowhere and you can t say stuff from out of nowhere when every second line is yours they also brought in the standard cousin oliver only this time it just wasn t a kid whenever you heard somebody knock on the door you started praying it wasn t randy please let it not be randy the deal with randy was that he d do really awful jokes usually as red would say smiling like an ass and totally screwing up delivery and donna would be in stitches i think more than half of the last season was donna pretending to be amused the problems had started earlier though: what once was a truly great show with an equally great concept that for once wasn t about a dysfunctional family slowly got into the territory of soap opera everybody started being in love with everybody emotional scenes were dragged out at nausea with just one usually lame joke placed somewhere to divert attention that we were watching as the world turns i m guessing this was character development but come on that was written almost as clumsily as the moral lessons from family matters to be fair the last episode also because it had a cameo by topher grace a cameo in his own show was really good even if not that funny either by the way yet more criticism on season : what the hell was with the opening theme not only did they use the same joke twice a character not singing fez scared the hell out of me dude don t open your eyes that far but the first five seasons or so among the best comedy ever broadcast 	POS

this tale based on two edgar allen poe pieces the fall of the house of usher dance of death poem is actually quite creepy from beginning to end it is similar to some of the old black-and-white movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house for example the cat and the canary the old dark house night of terror and so on boris karloff plays a demented inventor of life-size dolls that terrorize the guests he dies early in the film or does he and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences i won t go into too much detail here but it is definitely a must-see for fans of old dark house mysteries watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room dan basinger 	POS
henry fonda brilliantly captures what we have long believed abraham lincoln was like it is a fooler through fonda s performance we are led to believe on the surface that abraham lincoln was a country bumpkin but through his confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the court proceedings you can see that beneath the exterior posturings is a brilliant man who has a very good command of what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him in this movie henry fonda shows that he has a very good grasp of how to present humor it is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years when he is telling stories and jokes he has the timing down perfect there is a sequence in the trial that had me laughing quite hard he shows this gift again in the lady eve in the ending by john ford is absolutely brilliant with henry fonda going to the top of a hill and in the distance a tremendous storm symbolic of the civil war he goes forward into history the movie is fiction but the insight into lincoln is tremendous definitely worth seeing again 	POS

the internet database lists this as a tv show and yes it was a series on mtv shown on the oddities program after the head and before aeon flux if i recall correctly but the version i watched this time was a vhs tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes you have the story of the maxx julie winters sarah and mr gone the maxx is a super-hero or a bum julie a social worker or a leopard queen sarah a girl who should listen to less of the smiths and mr gone a guy who can t seem to keep his head on and then there s the other weird creatures i use or with maxx and julie because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams maybe they re all real or dreams maybe one of the characters doesn t exist maybe only one exists and dreams of the others you ll have to wait and find out i had the comic books before the show came out and it was one of my favorites the artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you ll find in superman or batman it will bend your mind and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive and the show used basically the same exact artwork only now it moves and the same story guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced this was the best show to appear on oddities hands down if you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip this is a show to check out it s donnie darko before there was ever such a thing the most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series but i don t say this in disappointment by keeping it simple they have sealed this movie in gold and kept it free from the blemishes brought on by successive failures 	POS

this was a very daring film for it s day it could even be described as soft-core porn for the silent era it was a talkie but dialog was extremely limited and in german one did not need it anyway the young hedy lamarr gets trapped in a loveless marriage to an obsessive stereotype german and after a short time in a marriage that was apparently never consummated returns home to her father in a famous and funny scene she decides to go skinny dipping one morning when her horse is distracted by another she is then forced to run across a field chasing after it as she left her clothing on the horse an engineer retrieves her horse and returns her clothing - after getting an eyeful they sit for a while and in a zen moment he presents her with a flower with a bee sitting on top this is where she thinks back to her honeymoon and the actions of her husband and an insect she knows this man is different she returns home and eventually seeks out our young fellow and finds the ecstasy she was denied you can use your imagine here but his head disappears from view and we see her writhing with pleasure since he never got undressed you can imagine certainly an homage to women by the director gustav machatý and a shock to audiences the only thing that mars this beautifully filmed movie is the excessive guilt and a strange ending 	POS

many mystery stories follow the standard whodunit path: murder most foul gathering of clues gaggle of possible perps sprinkling of red herrings and inevitable showdown between clever evildoer and even more clever crime solver forgotten abandons the well-trod and gives us complex characters who may or may not have committed terrible acts the fact that at the end of three episodes we have no easy answers and no neatly-tied package might frustrate some but for me it was the indication of an intelligently crafted tale which probes disturbs and haunts with the question: what does an evil person look like excellent acting and production combine to make a mystery not easily forgotten 	POS

police investigations murder suspicion: we are all so acquainted with them in movies galore most of the films nowadays deal with crime which is believed to involve viewers to provide them with a thrilling atmosphere however most of thrill lovers will rather concentrate on latest movies of that sort forgetting about older ones yet it occurs that these people may easily be misled a film entirely based on suspicion may be very interesting now despite being more than years old it is garde a vue a unique movie by claude miller is there much of the action not really since the events presented in the movie take place in a considerably short time but the way they are executed is the movie s great plus jerome charles martinaud michel serrault is being investigated by inspector gallien lino ventura and insector belmont guy marchand it s a new year s eve a rainy evening and not very accurate for such a meeting yet after the rape and murder of two children at the dawn of the old year the door of suspicion must be open at last in other words more quoted from the movie it must be revealed who an evil wolf really is to achieve this one needs lots of effort and also lots of emotions from both parties some people criticize the script for being too wordy yet i would ask them: what should an investigation be like if not many questions and practically much talk this wordiness touches the very roots of the genre in no way is this boring but throughout the entire film it makes you as a viewer as an observer involved moreover the film contains well made flashbacks as the stories are being told not too much and not too little of them - just enough to make the whole story clearer and more interesting the most memorable flashbacks for me are when chantal romy schneider martinaud s wife talks about one lovely christmas but these flashbacks also contain the views of the places including the infamous beach it all wonderfully helped me keep the right pace and since i saw garde a vue i always mention this film as one of the defenders of french cinema against accusations of mess and chaos but those already mentioned aspects may not necessarily appeal to many viewers since they might not like such movies and still won t find the content and its execution satisfactory yet garde a vue is worth seeing also for such people why for the sake of performances but here don t expect me to praise foremost romy schneider garde a vue is not romy schneider vehicle she does a terrific job as a mother who is deeply in despair for a lost child she credibly portrays a person who is calm concrete who does not refuse an offered cup of tea but who does not want to play with words her part which includes a profound talk of life and duty is brilliant more credible than the overly melancholic role of elsa in la passante de sans souci it is still acted however romy schneider does not have much time on screen practically she appears for the first time after minutes from the credits; she as a wife and a different viewpoint comes symbolically with the new year at midnight her role is a purely supporting one who really rocks is lino ventura he is the middle aged inspector antoine gallien who wants to find out the truth who is aware that his questions are missiles towards the other interlocutor but does not hesitate he is an inspector who having been married three times is perfectly acknowledged of women s psyche he is the one who does not regard his job as a game to play but a real service finally he is a person who does not find it abnormal to sit there on new year s eve michel serrault also does a fine job expressing fear particularly in the final scenes of the movie but thumbs up for mr ventura brilliant as far as memorable moments are concerned this is not the sort of film in which this aspect is easily analyzed the entire film is memorable has to be seen more than once and has to be felt with its atmosphere and which i have not mentioned before gorgeous music for me the talk of chantal and inspector gallien is the most brilliant flawless moment you are there with the two characters you experience their states of mind if you go deeper into what you see garde a vue is a very interesting film a must see for thrill lovers and connoisseurs of artistic performances new year has turned and is it now easier to open the door you ll find out when you decide to see the memorably directed movie by claude miller 	POS

i had few problems with this film and i have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated true it is over three hours long but i was amazed that it goes by so quickly i don t think it is overrated at all i think the imdb rating is perfectly decent the film looks sumptuous with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects and the direction from james cameron rarely slips from focus leonardo dicaprio gives one of his best performances as jack and kate winslet is lovely as rose david warner a great actor steals every scene he s in the story is very rich in detail and is hot on character development obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow the last hour is extremely riveting and i will confess that i was on the edge of my seat when the titanic sank i will also say that the last five minutes were very moving the music score by james horner was lovely though i never was a huge fan of the song my heart will go on the miniseries was good but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies overall i give titanic an bethany cox 	POS
as a comic book reader who still sees myself as a total kid at heart i admit i might have been a bit biased towards this movie i mean there hasn t been a good superhero movie out for quite some time note: batman forever was not a good superhero movie i really wanted this film to be good and unlike most of my recent trips to the cinema read blair witch project i wasn t disappointed mystery men was definitely not a high-effects tension-filled action flick it was a comedy and on that basis it was a success it had everyone in the small theater laughing and got applause and laughs right through the final scene stiller and garofolo are hilarious together as always and azaria adds just the right touch of craziness william h macy plays a great straight man while kel mitchell and the fart-powered paul rubens are added just to keep the kiddies happy though the sets are bizarre and at times seem like ripoffs from both batman and blade runner and some of the jokes are obvious it is still just plain funny there are some lines that will catch even the most jaded viewer off-guard and bring tears from the belly-laughers among us i definitely recommend this movie although not an all-time classic it is twice as funny as the latest austin powers retread the writing is good and the cast is great if you re worried plan on the matinee and pay less but either way you ll be pleasantly surprised i mean who among us doesn t root for the losers once in a while 	POS
when this film was made the hippie thing had gone mainstream the ideas of the counter culture was well established that is why such a big film could be made yet it has something to say and it is said really beautifully apart from those who re only waiting for the wanking material this film is given credit for its beautiful scenes which in itself is more than enough reason to see the film by the most the soundtrack to this film which actually became more popular than the film itself is another plus pink floyd s careful with that axe eugene suits really well with the explosions the absence of music in other scenes gives the film a nice quiet mood but it seems as though the messages in this film have been overlooked by the most if you didn t understand it which seems to be the case for the most i ll give you some hints: the man tough guy what ever his name is-mark is a part of a reality group he leaves this group saying something like i m willing to die but not of boredom he later go for a joyride with a stolen plane probably to seek some action as he is in the air grateful dead s dark star from the live dead album is played i think this song contains the phrase shall we go you and i while we can this is though not heard in the film perhaps stretching it a bit too far meaning that quote is essential in the plane he checks up a girl daria who is driving in her car to a conference about giving typical suburban families the opportunity to live in a super-relaxing place in the desert where everything is so simple and nice for the whole family by diving down almost hitting the car he lands the plane and joins the girl on her way to detroit they stop at zabriskie point where they enjoy each other as living creatures and the nature later a family with a big car of the type which you sleep in and a speed boat is showed visiting zabriskie point the father saying something like what a waste driving all the way up here and the kid sitting inside the car grinning i sensed a this wasn t much better than on the telly -attitude daria takes mark back to the plane which now is painted in a psychedelic style with the identity number changed to no war on one side and no words on the other bucks sucks is also written on the plane mark takes the plane back to where he stole it from saying to daria before he leaves i don t risk anything or something one of several hints about he not caring too much about his destiny this because he has the feeling that the environment that surrounds don t give him anything- i wonder what happens in the real world on the airport he is met by police officers who shoots him even though he just has returned the plane daria hears this on the radio but decides to go to the conference in the fancy mansion here she feels alien after the adventures with her just killed friend she enjoys fresh water running down a rock more than the swimming pool inside the house the viewer is once again given a hint about anti-materialism -she looks out through a glass wall holding her hands on the glass like she was trapped the business men is seen arguing the one side eager to make a big deal the other afraid of losing money daria leaves the house and looks back at it visualizing it blowing up after the house several other things blow up for example a television she smiles happy she has inside herself destroyed what she after the meeting with mark look upon as something negative to summarize: mark obviously experience the reality group as not very useful as they just sit and talk taking no action he clearly has bad feelings about things being as they are and it seems like he feels that it s no use fighting against it he wants to leave he helps daria who is in mind but not in action seeing his point of view where his feeling of being misfitted turns out leading to his death one can hope daria uses the ideas in a way that will turn out more constructive in the film you see how a town la is being polluted by commercial too bad you have to show the commercial to make the point you see business men deciding what is the future et cetera and you see people being unhappy with these and other situations which is parts of the modern world i have only seen the film once so i have not caught all points but i certainly got a feeling of what this film has to say and i find it strange that this film can be called meaningless if you say the points are being too obvious i can see why this film probably intended to appeal to the post-hippie radicals digging the thoughts of anti-establishment even though it has a lot to say and its message is still needed today things pretty much evolving in the same direction as it did before the sixties zabriskie point is a really great film telling a story about quite normal young people not far out hippies tripping around tip toe on acid digging everything seeking what they percept as real dissatisfied with the conventional and it is done in a truly beautiful way 	POS

i knew about but had never seen grey gardens before i saw the broadway musical of the same name friends cautioned me that if i had not seen the movie the musical would not make sense it did but it also prompted me to rent the movie at first i thought it was a train wreck full of strange shrieking characters and it was exceedingly hard to watch but being able to stop it digest it and go back to it made me realize why grey gardens is considered to be a memorable documentary both big edie and little edie are unforgettable and their utter lack of self-consciousness is worth witnessing both of them remain beautiful despite their encroaching age they have a relationship that will chill any woman and undoubtedly some men and make you re- examine your own dealings with your mother in an era when reality television and cinema is commonplace it s fascinating to see the mayleses work from three decades ago and realize what an impact the film must have had i echo what other posters have said: how were they allowed to slip into such squalor by their family but beyond that how could two people living in the s be able to escape reality in such a complete fashion or were they simply considered too crazy to be helped i would highly recommend watching this with the commentary track which gave me additional insight into the film 	POS

 directors had the same task: tell stories of love set in paris naturally some of them turned out better than others but the whole mosaic is pretty charming - besides wouldn t it be boring if all of them had the same vision of love here s how i rank the segments that might change on a second viewing : quartier latin by gérard depardieuone of the greatest french actors ever directed my favourite segment featuring the always stunning gena rowlands and ben gazzara witty and delightful tour eiffel by sylvain chometcute visually stunning thanks to the director of the triplets of belleville story of a little boy whose parents are mimes; tuileries by ethan and joel coenthe coen brothers + steve buscemi = hilarious parc monceau by alfonso cuarón y tu mamá también children of men feat nick nolte and ludivine sagnier funny ; place des fêtes by oliver schmitz feat seydou boro and aissa maiga touching ; th arrondissement alexander payne s election about schmidt wonderful look for the pathetic side of life is present here feat the underrated character actress margo martindale hilary swank s mother in million dollar baby as a lonely middle-aged american woman on vacation; faubourg saint-denis tom tykwer s run lola run frantic style works in the story of a young actress natalie portman and a blind guy melchior beslon who fall in love; père-lachaise by wes craven feat emily mortimer and rufus sewell plus a curious cameo by alexander payne as oscar wilde ; loin du ème by walter salles and daniela thomas simple but moving story from the talented brazilian directors feat catalina sandino moreno ; quartier des enfants rouges by olivier assayas clean a sad story feat the always fantastic maggie gyllenhaal; le marais by gus van sant feat gaspard ulliel elias mcconnell and marianne faithful simple but funny ; quartier de la madeleine by vincenzo natali feat elijah wood and olga kurylenko; quais de seine by gurinder chadha; place des victoires by nobuhiro suwa feat juliette binoche and willem dafoe; bastille by isabel coixet fabulous director of the underrated my life without me feat miranda richardson sergio castellitto javier cámara and leonor watling; pigalle by richard lagravenese feat bob hoskins and fanny ardant; montmartre by and with bruno podalydès; porte de choisy by christopher doyle with barbet schroeder mostly known as the director of barfly reversal of fortune and single white female i could classify some segments as brilliant and others as average or even slightly boring but not a single of them is plain bad on the whole i give paris je t aime an and recommend it for what it is: a lovely mosaic about love and other things in between 	POS
this is without doubt my favourite le carre novel and it is transformed to the silver screen with all the love and care one could wish for i read a review on this site that seems to find the characters loathsome but i believe this misses the point all le carre stories are essentially love stories and this is no exception it is an accurate reflection of the period in which it is set betrayal is the key by everybody for the good of nobody pym upbringing is so close to my own that i find it chilling watching peter egan is in his finest role and the late lamented ray mcanally is unbelievably good even the smallest roles played by such as andy de la tour tim healy and jack ellis are spot on this cast is a theatre impresario s dream the story should not be spoiled by ill informed description but suffice it to say it relates to a young mans slow but inexorable destruction and descent into espionage and treason all my sympathies lie with magnus pym and his sole non sexual love for poppy rüdiger weigang-as wonderful as always his only true friendship but also by definition another in the long line of betrayals outstanding rent it buy it love it 	POS
short but long enough cat soup is a very wild trip to watch one day i was just searching though my on-demand list through the anime section and came across it and decided to watch it i spent the whole time basically sitting with my jaw agape the whole time i was either vacant of thought or had a fleeting one which screamed turn it off but i didn t and actually i m glad i did the animation is stunning very artistic odd and dark i personally loved it for the amazing animation but the seemingly vacant story behind it is equally compelling for myself a young boy--well cat--goes in search of his sister s soul in the first part she s lying sick in bed and is soon paid by a visit from a sort of grim reaper her soul is split in half one is regained by the cat boy while the other half is lost then the rest of the film is slightly lost to me honestly i expect they go back and their world is perhaps slowly falling apart maybe her absence of soul is the answer behind this for the rest of the film contains various stages of which the world s in first there s a giant flood and next it dries up into a bleak desert and then everything freezes thanks to either what is god or fate as you will see then i believe they find the sister s soul in the form of an orange flower after that the whole world disappears haha totally didn t get that but it sends shivers down my spine each time despite it s seemingly random scenes i m sure there s a deeper message behind it if you watch it enough and do some research personally i love trippy stuff like this and would love to spend time doing that just to understand it but to some people it s probably not their cup of tea it comes off as highly disturbing so if you like your straight forward anime this is not a film for you if you have an open mind however i highly recommend this movie 	POS
much in the same way frank miller and his sin city comics used black and white to express itself and its film noir influences so does christian volckman with renaissance it is the year in paris in the tradition of science fiction the future is a bright sparkling multi-teared jewel this is a jewel in a setting of misery inequity and darkness; bright and beautiful on top with a dark underbelly beneath one of these bright people at the top a research scientist from a very large and influential global company avalon is kidnapped the well known and efficient captain karas voiced by the new james bond himself - daniel craig is assigned the task to find her the plot and layout is not overly original it is heavily influenced by film noir gibson s neuromancer and other detective stories along with movies like blade runner sin city fritz lang s metropolis and minority report there is the main plot surrounded by other possible sub-plots that all connect at the end it is not hard to figure it all out the movie s strength and originality is in its intense visual presentation paris is an intricate array of levels and sub-levels at its base is the more primitive industrial infrastructure as the city rises so does its architectural complexity and luminescence yet in this structure the top does not equate with elevation of human ideals and behavior paris has been intricately animated and laid out in brilliant black and white the movie is closer in spirit with sin city the comics then sin city the movie was with its source material this is done all the more easy because it is still remaining in relatively the same medium; animation much in the same way as a scanner darkly pushed the visual aspects of story telling so does this the light and dark black and white creates an atmosphere of contrasts as well as visual ambiguity right and wrong black and white can lose all meaning at the same time it is right in front of us the movie proves how black and white can be both ambiguous and obvious at the same time in keeping with the spirit of the movie i can be both critic and fan i can love and loath in the same light it is definitely an experience i recommend for lovers of the visual arts so pour another black and tan enter the void and enjoy the ride 	POS
while the sparkling chemistry between ryan and robbins alone is reason enough to see this movie the supporting cast including matthau fry shalub durning and the hilarious trio of jacobi saks and maher is an additional plus matthau shines as einstein fry is perfect as ryan s clinical fiancé and shalub s line about einstein s gonads is as has been noted one of the highlights of the film the speech that robbins delivers at his first appearance in public is sheer poetry kudos to the writers for handling this froth with wit and levity i also thought that keene curtis was wonderful as eisenhower this might be considered something of a chick movie but i think everyone will get a kick out of it eight very solid points 	POS
to anyone who hasn t seen this film yet i have a friendly warning: don t watch la casa dell orco expecting any demons at all because you won t find them here this film is not a third installment to the demons series and it has nothing to do with it whatsoever except the fact that lamberto bava directed them as a matter of fact michele soavi s the church is also known an unofficial demons and it s a deceptive title in that case as well so go figure it is obvious that due to the demons films success; they tried to deceive the audience with misleading titles even though it is obvious that this is a disconnected story having said that i think it s unfair on the other hand to say that la casa dell orco is not worth the look honestly the movie is quite atmospheric and even though there are a few unintentionally hilarious situations i thought it was genuinely creepy on the whole nevertheless i think it s fair to say that the story somehow tries to emulate lucio fulci s the house by the cemetery of course that s just a speculation i have but i think i have my valid evidences for instance in both films paolo marco is the man of the family in both films there s an irritating little son named bobby in both films the woman of the house is a beautiful thirty-something who seems to be the only one to see that there s something really wrong in the new house and in both films there s something really really wrong going on in the basement i m sorry but i can relate both films very easily and i m not saying that as an accusation for the contrary my point is that those who enjoyed the house by the cemetery are probably going to enjoy this movie as well keeping in mind of course that la casa dell orco is far less pretentious less scary not nearly as atmospheric but the formula is still there in la casa dell orco charel her husband tom and their little son bobby go on a vacation trip to an old deserted castle situated in the heart of an italian villa called trifiri leaving aside the beauty of the place shortly after their arrival charel starts to have the feeling that she has been there before which is impossible considering that she had never been to trifiri before sadly charel can t get over her déjà vu and the worst part is that her visions come along with the image of a horrendous creature going after her tom who is not a very patient guy to begin with advices her to leave the nonsensical hallucinations aside and enjoy the vacation however the woman s visions become more and more real and the peace and quiet that they were supposed to enjoy suddenly turn into a living nightmare the old nightmare from charel s childhood becomes real and this time she won t be able to escape without confronting that menacing ogre first as it is expected the plot somehow turns out to be a little bit simplistic and as a consequence it is hard to fill an hour and a half this means that la casa dell orco offers more than a couple of sequences with nothing but total silence and the image of the main character walking around the castle for several minutes reviving the images of her childhood and nothing else it gets rather tedious from time to time but overall it s nothing serious like many italian horror films that came out throughout the late eighties this movie is pretty stylish and effective but it also offers a nice variety of unintentionally funny moments that make the movie unforgettable in a way for instance the part in which charel is brutally slapped by her husband and instead of going to her bedroom crying like i would have expected she strikes back against him by punching him on the face really hard and running away to the woods like a maniac the funniest thing however is the fact that two minutes later they re a happy couple again as if punching each other like that was the most natural thing in the world i know it s silly but i myself found it absolutely hilarious the ogre which is obviously the villain of the story looks creepy and funny at the same time too and let s face it: a villain who can freak us out and make us laugh a little bit it s twice as welcomed it reminded me of michael jackson in thriller but much more natural and human of course but if focusing on the genuinely good aspects that i mentioned before: the music composed by simon boswell is one of the high points and even if it pretty much always the same it fits perfectly and it helps to create a rather dark atmosphere during the moments of tension so if i have to give my final statement regarding this movie i m going to have to say that i can t help loving it including the small flaws and most people who enjoy these typical italian horror movies from the late eighties won t be disappointed by this one it has all the typical and always well received clichés like the crazy old man who actually speaks the truth the foxy local woman who is said to be a witch a creepy castle a huge dark basement with a terrible secret and the local folks who try to prevent the tourist with their hostility to stay away from the infamous lands i would say that la casa dell orco deserves two thumbs up and a punch at your spouse s face as a way to pay tribute to the heroine of the story take this movie for what it is and enjoy it 	POS
a young girl surviving as a prostitute a cheap hustler who wants to get the big score they meet each other in thailand you may think by the opening titles it s going to be a violent movie but it is also a story of love with two persons in their own struggle to get the money for a better way of life this film feels like an essay sometimes because of its changes of images but still refreshing this story is also about eros and thanatos it s not an original joke but it is well told says a character and that also applies to this one: we ve seen the story but this way we see it thailand appears in hot tones the photograph going from one colored to a multicolored place and it captures the city as the cage of this imperfect persons there is also a good use of the music to dot the actions 	POS
great fun i went with friends to a sneak preview viewing of this film we came to see different one but after minutes wondering what the heck we got ourselves into this time the jokes became funny and they stayed funny throughout the movie in the first part you just keep asking yourself about this malinski and bellini stuff there are many more examples of this lingo and because they keep repeating the same jokes with different twists they get funnier and funnier in search for this malinski all the main characters are introduced the first one even wackier than the next until half of the film was over we didn t even know the name of this movie because there were no opening credits and we went to this sneak viewing but we sure had a good time the house was loaded appr people and i think about half of them didn t like it and the other half loved the film if you like weird comical movies with great dialogue you will love it apart from clooney this movie deserves a lot better than the imdb rating it has at the time i write this but when more ppl have seen it i am sure it will go up is reasonable i guess i would give it an out of out of after a few beers 	POS
simon s carefully written dialogues are truly electrified by matthau and burns you can literally hear the script crackle there are few movies out there that can develop such a relationship between the actors and the script for example the famed reunion scene could have been a lot duller with less-quality actors involved matthau seems to had been born to play willie clark of course oscar moreso in the odd couple and with all of the little idiosyncracies and mannerisms that matthau crams into the character the line where he is arguing that he is with it since he lives in the city whereas lewis lives in the country that lewis is out of touch is the quintessential example of this make this one of the best performances i ve ever seen of any actor in any role be it comedic or drama or whatever else period matthau and burns work excellently together; the contrast they portray accentuates simon s superb knack at creating comedic conflict this movie is simply one of the ultimate must-sees and does demand a rightful prestigious place in the pages of film history 	POS
when plague breaks out in new orleans it s richard widmark to the rescue in panic in the streets one of the lesser-celebrated films of the great elia kazan kazan keeps the pace brisk and there are lots of marvelous touches - the scenes between widmark and barbara bel geddes who plays his wife and the scene in the police station show family life and work life and the relationships of average citizens which is in sharp contrast to the lives and relationships of the low-lifes portrayed by a menacing jack palance his weak yes man zero mostel tommy cook and louis charles there are also some interesting visuals - palance has a couple of scenes with actors who seem to come up to his knees in height the acting is marvelous and the dialogue sharp if the story isn t quite up to the direction and performances it has a few questionable aspects which will be spotted by the viewer quite easily that aside it s well worth viewing kazan was a masterful director 	POS

all right here s the deal: if you re easily offended then you might want to stay far far away from this one there are some painfully funny moments in the movie but i probably blushed about as much as i laughed actually i probably blushed more than i laughed and if i wasn t literally blushing on the outside then i was blushing on the inside if there is absolutely nothing in this movie that embarrasses you then you simply have no shame whether that s a badge of honor or not is in the eye of the beholder i suppose i will not deny that i laughed quite a bit but this is a movie that i simply cannot give a blanket recommendation due to its subject matter if i were to say this movie is hilarious go check it out and some sweet little old church-going lady heads to the theater and has a heart-attack during one of the graphically explicit sex situations well that s just something i don t need on my conscience so how raunchy is it hmm try about times worse than the wedding crashers honestly my mom would ve walked out during the first scene i feel it s my duty to at least warn you of what to expect there is some cleverly intelligent comedy here but that s what i come to expect from the man judd apatow who had a hand in both freaks and geeks and undeclared i m all for making fun of michael mcdonald; the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give kenny rogers a run for his money paul rudd proclaiming if i hear ya mo be there one more time i ll ya mo burn this place down is hilarious but it s one of those things that the majority of the audience won t appreciate and when we see a quick -second flashback of steve carrell singing along to cameo s word up i laughed for a good two minutes after the joke was over whereas most everybody chuckled and then forgot about it strangely enough despite the raunch there s an admirable moral to the story the movie doesn t portray carrell as some freaky loser just because he s a virgin he s really portrayed as a likable admirable character sure he s a little weird after all he has a framed asia poster more videogames than an asian kid and a toy collection that features the million dollar man s boss but we re never led to believe that there s actually anything wrong with the fact that he s a virgin as odd as it may seem there s a bit of an it s ok to wait message but man oh man please be warned that this pushes its r rating about as far as it can go that was certainly apatow s intention according to him he just let some of the guys particularly rogen and malco improv and talk the way they normally talk all in an effort to find lots of new ways to be dirty if you can handle that or talk that way yourself then you ll love the movie i m not a big fan of excessive profanity and sex jokes i find that subtle clever humor is much more entertaining than about uses of the f-word or fratboy sex discussions but that s me like i said there are some absolutely hysterical moments here but you have to ask yourself if they re worth sitting through one of the most vulgar movies you re likely to ever see at the theater i just don t know how interested most women will be in what s discussed by men while playing poker honestly ladies you might not want to know if you ve ever been curious why some girls think guys are gross well this gives you a good idea there you go - my humble honest take on what to expect be that your guide it definitely should not be seen with your sunday school class mama grandmama any family members of the opposite sex children of any age or anybody who is easily offended by excessive profanity or explicit sex discussion if you d see it with any of the above then you apparently do not have any concept of what it means to be uncomfortable 	POS

this was the third muppet movie and the last one jim henson was around to take part in the making of before his premature death in the first three films starring the famous characters were all made and released into theatres before i was born i originally saw the first and second installments in the original trilogy the muppet movie and the great muppet caper around the mid-nineties as a kid but didn t see this third one the muppets take manhattan until april this was shortly after i had seen its two predecessors and s muppet treasure island for the first time in many years this third muppet movie definitely didn t disappoint me the first time i saw it and my second viewing nearly three years later may not have impressed me as much but if not it certainly didn t go too far downhill the muppets stage musical manhattan melodies turns out to be a big hit on their college campus they are graduating from college so they will soon be leaving but decide they will all stay together and go to manhattan to try and get their show on broadway after their arrival they begin searching for a producer but after many rejections they finally decide to part and go find jobs most of them leave town but kermit stays and is still determined to find the right producer and reunite the muppet gang he gets a job at a new york restaurant owned by a man named pete the frog quickly befriends pete s daughter jenny an aspiring fashion designer who currently works at her father s restaurant as a waitress as kermit continues his attempts to reach stardom now with the help of jenny he doesn t know that miss piggy has secretly stayed in new york and is now spying on him she begins to see kermit and jenny together and to her it looks like they re getting close which leads to jealousy when i saw this movie for the second time it looked disappointing at first it seemed a little rushed unfocused and maybe even forgettable around the beginning there are some funny bits during this part of the film such as animal chasing a woman through the audience on the college campus but for a little while the film seemed bland to me compared to its two predecessors fortunately it wasn t long before that changed the film is entertaining for the most part with saying goodbye the poignant song the muppets sing as they part and a lot that happens after that the two funniest parts might be miss piggy s tantrums after she sees kermit and jenny hugging but there were definitely many other times when i laughed such as poor fozzie trying to hibernate with other bears the muppets still have their charm and comical antics which obviously also helps carry the movie for the most part as does the plot a simple but intriguing one for all ages there are some weaker moments such as the muppet babies sequence and juliana donald s performance as jenny is lacklustre but neither of these problems are too significant and are far from enough to ruin the entire experience i would say the muppet movie the film that started the franchise in is the best of the original trilogy and that seems to be the most popular opinion this third film is probably the weakest of the three but all of them are good unlike muppets from space the third of the theatrical films in the franchise made after henson s sad passing at least the muppets take manhattan is still the muppets i won t go into details about what i think of the muppets film released twenty years after their first one since i ve already explained in my review of it why i found it so disappointing and even though it does have some appeal i m clearly not alone however every theatrical movie starring the lovable muppets that was made during henson s life is good entertainment for the whole family even if the second and third installment each showed a slight decline in quality after the one that directly preceded it 	POS
in a group of raf officers including eric wiiliams decide to escape from a pow camp using a gymnastic vaulting horse in the courtyard in it was decided to film his account and it kick-started a peculiar british film genre- the military prison camp story that reached its apogee in danger within the wooden horse is one of the quietest films i have ever watched there are no great dramatic moments but a steady storyline eventually builds to a climax that has more tension because the story doesn t give way for unlikely drama jump cuts or jacked up somethings about to happen music it is utterly of its time and works beautifully leo glenn anthony steel and david tomlinson lead a curiously low key cast of extras and i suspect non-actors without exception all are constantly mono-tonal and quiet they keep emotion out of their roles as so many were until recently ex-service i suspect they recreated their war time roles as officers and gentlemen this unemotional approach does not detract from any dramatic tension on the contrary unlike most wartime escape films the story doesn t end at the barbed wire: and that fact alone keeps me glued to the end 	POS

i m fond of this film and it vexes me that so many reviewers rank it below the peter jackson trilogy a filmed novel is always interpretive; in particular an animated film relies on the artist s vision and should be judged on its own terms speaking as a purist this is a finer homage to tolkien than the updated version while this film has its flaws it stays truer to the source especially so far as the characters are concerned in the jackson version tolkien s frodo is barely recognizable: from the first scenes he is portrayed as a weakling constantly wavering manipulated by forces around him and never standing on his own two feet this is physically and metaphorically true you wonder why fate chose this limp biscuit to carry the one ring to the cracks of doom jackson unforgivably rewrites tolkien and robs frodo of his finest moment when he allows arwen to rescue him from the ringwraiths bakshi s version respects the original presenting a frodo who demands the wraiths go back and trouble me no more bakshi sustains frodo s character as tolkien conceived it we see his decline as the weight of his burden increases frodo is so pivotal to lord of the rings you wonder why jackson took such liberties he does so with numerous characters since character development propels the plot to its inevitable conclusion bakshi s film better explores the companionship between legolas and gimli in a few judicious scenes that are completely lacking in jackson s version similarly we see boromir horsing with pippin and merry furthering the idea of fellowship for my liking the camaraderie is more developed in the animated version than the live action tolkien s poetry is an important ingredient in the novels and bakshi makes tribute to this in one of my favorite scenes: when frodo sings the merry old inn song minutes before stumbling into strider the cheery tune is chillingly juxtaposed with the darker theme music when seconds later invisible to his friends but visible to the wraiths frodo is dangerously exposed this is one of the most atmospheric portions of the film and chills me whenever i see it the well documented budget time restrictions limit this film s final impact but had it been completed it may have resonated with more viewers as it is it s worth a look even its detractors admit that peter jackson derived much of his inspiration from this prototype 	POS
as a disclaimer i ve seen the movie - times in the last years and i only just saw the musical this week this allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn t in the musical however it tainted me when i watched the musical : i actually believe michael douglas worked quite well in that role along with kasey i think her let me dance for you scene is one of the best parts of the movie a worthwhile addition compared to the musical the dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical as well as the cast which is at least times bigger easier to do in the movie of course the decors lighting dancing and singing are also much superior in the movie which should be expected and was indeed delivered the songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie the new ones are quite good ones and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion especially compared to a musical which has few decors the one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters but their dancing is impeccable and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical	POS
this movie is soooo funny the acting is wonderful the ramones are sexy the jokes are subtle and the plot is just what every high schooler dreams of doing to his her school i absolutely loved the soundtrack as well as the carefully placed cynicism if you like monty python you will love this film this movie is a tad bit grease esk without all the annoying songs the songs that are sung are likable; you might even find yourself singing these songs once the movie is through this musical ranks number two in musicals to me second next to the blues brothers but please do not think of it as a musical per say; seeing as how the songs are so likable it is hard to tell a carefully choreographed scene is taking place i think of this movie as more of a comedy with undertones of romance you will be reminded of what it was like to be a rebellious teenager; needless to say you will be reminiscing of your old high school days after seeing this film highly recommended for both the family since it is a very youthful but also for adults since there are many jokes that are funnier with age and experience 	POS
spoilers - in as far as i describe characters and their relation to the plot this is a quality film the subject matter is at once grim and gripping the dogged determination of stephen rea s character burakov is simply captivating with any due apologies to him his hangdog continually put-upon expression serves the character well he is as we in england would say of the inspector taggart tv series character bound to be grim because he sees three murders a week well that s not strictly accurate as chikatila operated over a number of years you get a real sense of the blankwall resistance of the ussr bureaucracy brilliantly portrayed by joss ackland who often seems made for this sort of role a key character and i write this as the remake of invasion of the body snatchers is being shown on bbc is the donald sutherland character mikhail fetisov his quiet support of burakov is steadfast and it endures through perestroika and drives the involvement of the fbi for profiling brilliant this is a must-see as far as i am concerned 	POS
spoilers many different comedy series nowadays have at one point or another experimented with the idea of obscure independence in an early episode of cartoon family guy the griffin family find their home is an independent nation to the united states of america and the story progresses from there way back in however the ealing studios produced a wonderful little film along the same idea after a child s prank the residents of pimlico discover a small fortune in treasure at the inquest it becomes clear that the small area is a small outcrop of the long lost state of burgundy withdrawing from london and the rest of great britain the residents of the small street experience the joys and the problems with being an independent state based at a time when rationing was still in operation this story is brilliantly told and equally inspiring featuring performances by stanley holloway betty warren philip stainton and a young charles hawtrey the film is well stocked with some of the finest actors of their generation these actors are well aided as well by a superb little script with some cracking lines feeling remarkably fresh despite being over years old the story never feels awkward and always keeps the audience entertained ealing studios was one of the finest exporters of british film ever in existence with films like passport to pimlico it s not difficult to see why amusing from start to finish the story is always fun and always worth watching 	POS
i finally watched these episodes in and i had to continually go back and verify when they were actually produced they are absolutely scary in that they made spot on fun of what would be the future either parker and stone lived in texas and witnessed the idiocy of gov bush or they are those weird eerie people that pay attention to things boo scary bush s frat bros invading the white house dressed as arabs wielding rifles bush accidentally executing someone no wait he did sort of do that as gov this may have seemed a failure as a sitcom at the time but must now be considered as brilliant if spooky prescience 	POS
as a baseball die-hard this movie goes contrary to what i expect in a sports movie: authentic-looking sports action believable characters and an original story line while angels in the outfield fails miserably in the first category it succeeds beautifully in the latter two angels weaves the story of roger and j p two anaheim foster kids in love with baseball but searching for a family with that of the woebegone angels franchise struggling to draw fans and win games pushed by his deadbeat father s promise that they would be a family only when the angels win the pennant roger asks for some heavenly help and gets it in the form of diamond-dwelling spirits bent on reversing the franchise s downward spiral and when short-fused manager george knox portrayed by danny glover begins believing in what roger sees the team suddenly has hope for turning their season around--and roger and j p find something to believe in glover in particular gives a nice performance and tony danza playing a washed-up pitcher also does well despite clearly having zero idea of how to pitch out of the windup 	POS
i don t doubt that the critics panned this movie especially the artsy fartsys who need a laxative this is a great vehicle movie in the tradition of abbot & costello or more recently don knotts it won t shake the world or change movies forever what it will do is entertain when all is said & done that s the most important thing anyway watch this movie & forget your troubles it even has a simple & kind moral message at no extra charge i always loved elvira s tv show when i lived in la she did not really steal her schtick from vampira any more than vampira did from the original theda bara this sort of mythic character belongs to whoever does it best; & cassandra peterson does it best long live elvira; we need more of these kind of movies there are never enough the villain william morgan sheppard was also excellent he exudes a wonderful refined malice i could find no technical faults the execution is as close to flawless as the art form gets my profound compliments to the director james signorelli & all his crew 	POS
i voted excellent for how well the acting was not for the content it still gives me chills after reading the book then watching the movie two ex-cons are traveling to their destination to rob a family of money from a safe one of the cons learned about while in prison during the ride the tension begins to mount as the soundtrack in the movie adds to the overall anticipation after the killers are done with their work at the farm the following morning the family s remains are found by the daughter s church friend the blood-curdling scream as the scene pans onto the telephone with the cut cord really made my blood run cold and gave me chills that the killers met their just fates is a small comfort for this doomed family robert blake was excellent in his portrayal of perry smith the book was also excellently written by truman capote 	POS
it s a difficult movie to classify items or less generally i don t care about defining genres but there s something about this movie that makes you want to put it in a specific category in order to transmit even with only one word your feelings about it i completely recommend this film to anyone and if you truly enjoy cinema and if you enjoy life you ll want to do the same as soon as you ve finished watching it i recommend this movie and call it beautiful and delightful admitting it s not perfect but it doesn t do anything wrong i don t want to sound like i contradict myself but i believe writer director brad silberling knew exactly what he was getting into when he finished writing this inspiring script i m sure he wanted to achieve a product that had nothing to do with perfection: a product that would be as simple appealing and uncompromising as its title well he s done it silberling director of long complex dramatic movies like city of angels and moonlight mile proves with items or less which closes in at just minutes the passion he has for his work and also the faith he has in it to put an actor morgan freeman in front of a woman paz vega in a grocery store and take them exactly to the places ordinary life would take them is what silberling proposes here i can t tell you no more because within the apparent simplicity lies a thought provoking background that shouldn t be underestimated because here everyone s exposed: the camera focuses directly on the two main characters who share endless conversation in a car ride with stops that s not endless only because life is life and let me express how praise how well silberling handles the situation by saying that he reaches in less time not only in movie duration time but in the single day that the movie develops its events and in a smaller place the kind of connection between two characters that sofia coppola generated in lost in translation that movie set in tokyo also encountered an actor and a woman and they also had conversations about the moments they were living in their lives it s in the conversations where we sense the though provoking quality of items or less and just as in coppola s movie the naturalness of every situation is never lost and the images with all music and no words don t seem forced or included in the picture to buy time in this aspect the collaboration of silberling and his director of photography phedon papamichael the man who shot the beautiful sceneries in sideways and focused on every emotion in patch adams delights us here with visual passages of true natural beauty but the ultimate beauty of items or less can be found in its cast by avy kaufman in its two protagonists they are the ones who transmit this feeling i mentioned at the beginning and i can t specify; we feel their connection and we can tell they re having fun and that they may even be improvising stuff academy award winner morgan freeman also an executive producer of the film simply stands there and confirms the status he has today in the movie industry and one that s well deserved: a quiet man filled with wisdom that can easily make you cry as he can make you laugh and the beautiful paz vega well i said she was great in spanglish here she proves she s the real deal and hollywood s not small for her 	POS

dumland focuses on the lives of one american family the father; a violent and obscene person who loves to fart and use profanity and who has no redeeming qualities the mother; who appears to be a paranoid psychotic never really says much the son; an obscure annoying repetitive little fellow the animation is simple and crude but does suite the stories and the characters the episodes were originally only available from the davidlynch com website but have now been released on dvd there are episodes on the dvd and a brief synopsis follows: - the neighbor: we meet the next door neighbor and find out three things about him he has a really nice shed he only has one arm and he likes to do naughty things with ducks - the treadmill: we find out that the wife has an affinity for exercise but the husband doesn t really think it s a good idea in the end the exercise treadmill is victorious - the doctor: the father has an unfortunate accident with an exposed live wire the doctor s examination is quite thorough if not unconventional but the diagnosis is you are perfectly normal but we knew that - a friend visits: after an altercation with the new clothes hoist a friend comes to visit believe it or not he has one but after we meet him we can understand why no surprises when he tells us what his hobbies are - get the stick: we meet another neighbor he has a stick stuck in his mouth although we never find out how it got there unfortunately removing the stick from his neighbor s mouth ends up being harder and more violent than expected but he is victorious in the end jesus some people can be ungrateful - my teeth are bleeding: this was my favorite episode and was also the most mind- numbingly repetitive and annoying hmm what does that say about me not sure why the son s teeth started bleeding but believe me when i say it was minimal to the plot of the story which is an oxymoron as the story had no plot but did have a funny ending involving a fly - uncle bob: after meeting uncle bob and uncle bob s wife we get a distinct feeling that the dumbland gene-pool is very shallow uncle bob is a sickly fellow i shan t elaborate lest i spoil it for you uncle bob s wife definitely wears the pants in his family and the father definitely ends up on the wrong side of her ample fist and spends the rest of their visit cowering in a tree in the back yard - ants: after the home gets infiltrated with ants and a misbegotten attempt to bug-spray them goes awry he ends up spraying himself in the face with the bug-spray and starts hallucinating the ants put on a fabulous song and dance show he goes berserk trying to kill them winds up in a full body plaster and lets just say the ants get their vengeance in the end as bad as these stories are there is something that kept compelling me to watch them they do give another insight into the mind of one of my favorite directors david lynch maybe they were an outlet for him to get rid of some of his violent thoughts i did actually laugh out loud at many points within the episodes many aspects are absurdly funny 	POS
i have no idea how imdb sorts reviews but i do know that as happens often on amazon com there are a striking number of very negative reviews for this movie which repeat the same somewhat obscure talking points almost verbatim a campaign only imdb knows as for this movie: it s fine it s a funny cute and very straightforward movie it s been over a decade since i worked in brooklyn lived in queens and visited relatives in the south bronx but i found nothing inauthentic or exploitative about these kids is the grandmother a bizarre character yup do the dialogue and plot acknowledge this yes thankfully they do are other movies set in the les and featuring dominican puerto rican kids possible you betcha does that make this movie a crime  as some of the to my eyes astroturf comments would suggest hardly let a thousand plastic flowers bloom this is better than any episode of degrassi jr high or degrassi high scoff at the comparison but _we ve never had that_ and i m touched to the core by this movie s humility of purpose and tender spirit that said i d love to know the backstory behind all this backbiting :-d	POS
 spoilers herein what really scares you killer sharks or maybe ghosts trying to bring back a message maybe a chainsaw wielding psychopath maybe but those fears don t even compare to a horror which people dare not even speak of or consider--and that is the death of one s own child pet sematary taps this base primal adult fear and then takes it to places that most could not bear to explore i ve read comments about this film that include poor acting characters making stupid decisions etc i disagree the acting is actually first rate for a film like this maybe it is impossible for many to imagine the desperation resulting from such a scenario but the film s events are not only logical they may be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario were possible this is the true horror of pet sematary : it isn t that pets and people come back from the dead as evil killers who hunt with knives and scalpels it is that anyone who has lost a child could become so desperate as to commit the crimes that louis creed does despite warning or even past history the movie takes those willing to go with it to the depths of a desperate human heart the heart of a protector trying to make up for not being able to protect and the results are horrifying in fact when the film dives into slasher territory near the end it s almost a letdown although i believe it s perfectly logical how it got there i am a true horror fan and i contend that this is one of the scariest horror films ever made if you don t think so see it again after you have children 	POS

this is an ok adaptation but not as good as the tv version the actors are generally alright but i found jeremy northam rather wet as mr knightley particularly compared to mark strong in the tv version gwyneth paltrow is ok and her english accent is pretty good but again i preferred kate beckinsale s emma there are excellent support performances from toni collette juliet stephenson and sophy thompson the script is often played too much for laughs the book is a comedy but there are too many set-piece gags here and also the frank churchill subplot is almost completely absent my biggest criticism is the scenery it is far too lush england has never been like this it looks like a chocolate box only americans would make it like this despite these criticisms i enjoyed this film but would recommend the tv adaptation more 	POS

i have watched this movie on dvd a couple of times now the first time i watched the second half after the hour and then went back to the first hour an engrossing entertaining film thank god no kiera knightley in it refreshing and it gives us all a genuine insight into the difficult life of queen victoria and the difficult choices she had to make nothing bad about the movie at all no real bad language or anything of a sexual nature which would offend for family viewing might prompt the kids to research a little about the queen victoria herself and perhaps lesser known characters such as conroy and lord melbourne	POS
i enjoyed albert pyun s nemesis for its cheesy action and semi-complicated script a lot of people complain about the confusing plot to the first film which is probably why nemesis : nebula has a dumb as rocks plot with the same super-action to carry it through this one gives the name of the first movie s hero alex to a bulked up super-female sent to the past to save the future she is raised by a tribe in africa a good portion of the film only has dialogue in an african tongue without subtitles which i liked because it made it seem somewhat authentic how often do movies in this genre really try to do that it doesn t take long for the evil cyborgs to time travel back in time to find her and try to kill her don t get me wrong this is a piece of crap not that the first one was anything great there are subplots involving africa s political unrest treasure hunting and tribal combat the picture is very short on brains so none of these things gets a very good treatment the picture is basically a drawn out fight with some chases that boils down to muscle-babe vs cyborg it has its entertainment value just don t expect quality or anything of the first movie 	POS

grand epic as it is kenneth branagh s monumental rendering of what is perhaps william shakespeare s most popular tragedy suffers under the weight of its four hour playing time and certainly takes some real staying power two entirely separate sittings would most likely be better in order to fully appreciate what is certainly high class film making while i absolutely acknowledge this masterpiece as such i must confess to a lack of enthusiasm for the old bards flamboyance his rhetoric and he sends himself up so well and his many flourishes thus hamlet loses its impact as it loses its grip from patrick doyle s music to alex thomson s cinematography to tim harvey s exquisite sets the movie is a feast of visual and aural delights which compliments a fine cast branagh has taken on three huge mantels adapting directing and playing his adaptation is superb his direction strong but by the time he got to the role of hamlet the strain seemed to be showing; yet still he does a fine job in what is an incredibly taxing role derek jacobi gobbles up the sinister claudius with glee and julie christie is most dramatic as his queen gertrude richard briers is marvellous as polonius and charlton heston is once again a strong screen influence as the player king many others drop by including jack lemmon superb in a very small role billy crystal dame judi dench sir john mills sir john gielgud sir richard attenborough and gerard depardieu the acting prize though must go to one of the great thespian discoveries of recent years kate winslet hers is a moving portrayal of the most tragic figure in this whole affair ophelia to finish before this review goes on longer than the film i must say it is the length that really tests the viewer in this movie branagh has directed with purpose giving many important impacting scenes too many of them outstay their welcome watching this film holds a fantastic reminder of the many pearls of wisdom we have garnered from it neither a lender nor a borrower be or be true to thyself and of course: to be or not to be the opening two hours does take some perseverance but if you do manage to stay tuned you are sure to be treated to a rousing finale which gathers momentum from the tragic funeral onward monday june - hoyts croydon	POS
anyone who finds this film boring is a hopeless bonehead who should stick to car chase movies and romantic comedies this film is riveting and doesn t have a boring moment why because it is comprised largely of intelligent dialogue between real people in a moment of crisis and details their efforts to survive that crisis i repeat--intelligent dialogue that is what characterizes nearly all of rohmer s films and that is why a lot of people don t like them they prefer action fine let them spend the rest of their lives watching action films while those of us with taste and discrimination will continue to seek out films like this rohmer has always been accused of being talky well he is but to me that s a compliment not a criticism shakespeare was talky too is there a talkier play than hamlet whenever the subject or theme of a work of art consists of ideas and conflicts over values there must of necessity be a discussion of these ideas and values an that is largely what this film is all about aristocracy and noble birth vs egalitarianism; loyalty to old friends that is put to the ultimate test when that friend takes what we believe to be a wrong path; the value of human life and the responsibility to help save that life even if the person possessing that life is not so nice or even despicable anyone ever hear of dostoyevsky or crime and punishment these are what this film is all about the two leads in this film are impeccable as if they were born to play these roles lucy russell who is english and speaks french as her second language is especially brilliant do yourself a favor and see this riveting film it may be the last film by this screen master 	POS

before zavet there was similarity between tim burton and kusturica artistic vision they find their own poetic style and then they cowardly become prisoners of it burton has and still have depp kusturica has miki manojlovic and somehow they got critical praise for repeating same formula over and over again however there are persons like me who find joke funny only when they heard it first time that s main reason why kusturica s worst movies are black cat white cat and life is miracle zavet is something completely different you may like it you may hate it but this is not just another kusturica poetic  balkanic dreamlike stuff of course if you want to be praised you have to play safe it was very easy for kusturica to make just another flying gypsies movie and get award fortunately as a brave person he chooses to make movie that will be ironic look to his previous works zavet can be described as a strong and very harsh parody on previous kusturica movies directed by kusturica himself it is beautiful to see one big movie director to not take himself too seriously this is quality that kusturica have and even the biggest like bergman or kubrick didn t have this movie is so meaningless that becomes absurd so absurd that becomes deep and so unfunny that becomes hilarious same stuff that make plan from outer space cult would made this masterpiece to people who knows how to watch it average western viewer would not get few references most notable tire shop owner is srbljanovic and this refers to biljana srbljanovic famous serbian dramatic writer politically she is very active as left oriented liberal and she despises kusturica s political views and anarchism kusturica s everything but not subtle take to her work was to castrate miki manojlovic in srbljanovic shop second reference is made to goran bregovic  previous kusturica s composer he formed funeral and wedding orchestra and start performing around europe although he is praised as big composer bregovic is just performer and most of his songs if not all are poor covers of traditional serbian songs kusturica s take on bregovic was to confront one wedding and one funeral with funeral mocking the wedding also music is covering western classics as london bridge is falling down or french lullabies you find this unfunny now you see how we feel in serbia when listening bregovic s horrible covers i really liked this movie because it is not pretending to be deep it is so overfilled with symbols that it becomes parody and it is beautifully directed as all of his works are if you like previous kusturica s movies there is a big chance that you will hate this if you don t like couple of his last movies you may find this as pleasant surprise because this is like fellini directing pink flamingos on purpose i have massive respect for this guy after zavet next tim burton movie would surely have main character with pale faces next kusturica movies can easily be about aliens invading earth that s the reason why he is most interesting director on earth whether you like it or not 	POS
but it is kinda hilarious at least if you grew up on weird al like i did it s a mockumentary about his life and career beginning with superstardom and going back to trace the origins it s uneven in places but some of the segments are still very funny particularly when he goes to japan although it s not quite as emotionally textured as lost in translation and he doesn t find love however fleeting he does capture in a bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural melange that is tokyo street life perhaps weird al isn t recognized as the insightful cultural commentator that he is; perhaps a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet still this is a funny movie 	POS
this movie is a real gem the arc of the the plot is defined in the first minutes the characters are sympathetic and clearly drawn their motives completely believable the dialogue is fresh and oh so real the situations are unique to the characters and not at all cliched or hackneyed until the climax that is then it s as if the movie went off the rails a bit and it got a bit hokey and unbelievable but i don t want to discourage people from watching this film the first s of it are truly remarkable i gave it an there are some remarkable performances here check out this movie 	POS
a fragment in the life of one of the first female painters to achieve historical renown artemisia tells the true story of a young italian woman s impassioned pursuit of artistic expression and the vicissitudes she encounters the film features sumptuous costuming and sets and a good cast and acting however it is muddled in its attempt to depict the esoterics of the art and the time and is uninspired in its representation of the passion of the artist as painted on canvas and explored through her involvements with men a good film for those interested in renaissance painting or period films 	POS
the last i believe of the movies the boys made with hal roach this is also the last truly funny film they made before going to th century fox which so famously misued their talents although there are weak moments - the business with the lung tester for instance is a bit ah overblown but worth having just to see dr jimmy finlayson - but on the whole this flick is a good summary of what the boys brought to the screen richard cramer uncredited appeared in other l&h flicks and he is delightfully threatening here as the convict nick granger the scene where the boys have to eat their own synthetic meal looks good smells good and it probably tastes good eat it is one of my favorite moments in the oeuvre stan & ollie will always be pleasant companions in the lives of their millions of devoted fans 	POS
i bought this movie a few days ago and thought that it would be a pretty shitty film but when i popped it into the dvd-player it surprised me in a very good way james belushi plays very well as bill the mouth manuccie but especially timothy dalton plays a very good roll as the sheriff the end scene in the house of bill is very excellent good camera-work nice dialogues and very good acting bill the mouth manuccie has stolen million dollars from the mafia together with his wife he lives in south-carolina in a witness protection program but the mafia tracks him down and wants the million dollar bill can only trust the only person he knows inside out himself 	POS

this is one of the weirder movies i have recently watched that s because it seems less like a movie and more like an experimental film kurasawa s experiment was to take a variety of individuals who live at a garbage dump and weave their experiences into a tapestry that offers glimpses of their generally harsh existences not every episode is depressing and harsh but overall this is definitely the tone let s see we have a case of incest rape attempted murder wife swapping alcoholism infidelity death of a little boy after eating tainted fish a man with severe depression he never talks during the movie and looks very scary a hopeless dreamer who would probably be diagnosed with schizophrenia a mentally retarded young man who thinks he is a street car conductor and spends all his waking moments driving his street car through paths among the garbage piles a man married to a total shrew i think i liked her character even less than the incestuous rapist etc etc in fact it is depressing enough that it seemed almost like an ingmar bergman movie set in japan as bergman made many movies that tended to deal with mental illness and the hopelessness of life is it any wonder that after making this film kurasawa tried to kill himself so did i like it no it was not a fun experience but it was a very well-made movie that definitely kept my attention and as a result i really wanted to see what happened to these people it was sort of like watching a train wreck--you don t want to see all the carnage but you can t help but watch of all the vignettes i think that the older man who tended to look out for everyone and who didn t really seem to fit in he was too well-adjusted and wise to be living in a garbage dump was perhaps meant to represent kurasawa himself maybe i dunno if you ve seen a variety of kurasawa films and have a high tolerance for strange art films give this one a watch however do not make this your first experience watching his movies--it s sure to scare away many viewers 	POS

there are few films or movies i consider favorites over the years the gospel road was one of them i watched this as a young teen and would like the opportunity to watch it again my favorite parts were the fact that jesus was blond the last supper was a huge meal he liked playing with the children his death was for all people and for all time the movie may not have been theologically sound or high quality acting but it touched my heart at that time besides i am a johnny cash fan and it was a brave venture if it ever comes out on dvd i will purchase it purely for sentimental reasons 	POS
considering all the teen films like the breakfast club and pretty in pink that are lionized it is surprising that this one is so ignored there is no sex in it but sex is thought of including the idea that it may matter what others think about it the kids do not always get along with their parents but neither the parents or the kids are seen as always right or wrong and the parents are not seen as monsters it deals with hero-worship how one girl does a dangerous thing which could have lead to real dustier before realizing that she was wrong the movie is kind of ahead of its time one kid asks another kid what birth control she uses she says she is doing nothing to need birth control she replies wrongly oral sex 	POS

 like the first touch of pleasure and guilt like a spontaneous youthful flirt of fascination and fear like a climax of contrary emotions said one of the movie buffs after viewing love at the top the misinterpreted title version of stylish director michel deville s le mouton enrage vincent canby in new york times however just after the premiere of the movie stated: love at the top which opened yesterday at the th street playhouse is a french comedy that dimly recalls a number of nineteen-fifties english comedies about the rise and rise of cynical young men possessingand possessed byambition yet the significant difference that he mentioned was the fact that love at the top is not concerned with the english class system january having left the evaluations up to single individuals of course the test of time has done its just job what may be said with certainty after more than years is that we can hardly find such movies like le mouton enrage where decadence appears innocent where liaisons appear youthfully enthusiastic where feelings occur so manipulative for romy schneider s fans it seems useless to point out that this film is a must see not only because she gives a unique performance as she did in all of her roles at the heyday of her career years before her sudden death but because she is particularly attractive here it is not trio infernal where the so to say forced escape from and the mockery of romy s sweet image haunted for years by saccharine sissi meets its most discouraging manifestation but a film where the brilliant actress is given a fair role she plays roberte a woman who becomes the object of lust for the story s lead playboy nicolas mallet jean louis trintignant it is him who takes financial profits from lustful liaisons this movie can boast truly memorable and unique shots of romy and she is given some of her very best scenes romy s sex appeal is unforgettable here another strong point of the film is its execution of the content with a development of individual perception immoral as it may seem the director makes a perfect use of contrast: conventions vs pleasures innocence vs decadence genuine lust vs instrumental affair nicola owns most of the features that viewers may like or detest may find attractive or disgusting; yet his are the features the viewers must treat seriously more to say they are the ones we all must accept that is why one is led to a peculiar gently wild erotically unique world of the main character although he sleeps with lots of women there are two women that represent a sort of contrary worlds for nicola: roberte groult romy schneider and marie-paul jane birkin he manipulates them makes love to them cannot refrain from both desire for their bodies and desire for money; yet he perceives them differently yet despite all of this adult maturity he is emotionally like a little boy who plays with a toy-car on the table - a sort of detailed insight into male mind in a comedy-like way of course finally there are very good performances which makes le mouton enrage slightly underrated not only the aforementioned romy schneider does a brilliant job supplying the viewers with an extraordinary insight into her role but young jane birkin appears to be convincing in the role of young inexperienced streetwalker marie paul jean louis trintignant makes it possible to see nicola in the right way this artistic merit lying in performances goes with terrific music by camille saint-saëns the tune that will ring in your ears for long therefore apart from some flaws of the movie like dated colors slow action sometimes possible clichés noticed by some viewers the merits should be found significant le mouton enrage in sum is a clear manifestation of contrary manipulative tools in life it is worth seeing as a moment in romy s career a prelude to strong eroticism a chain of contrary emotions of love and hatred appreciation and disgust compared to the first orgasm and the first angasm but aren t we humans viewers movie buffs built upon such contrasts 	POS

this movie is so complex that it can be given any description and still roll with it you have a insecure troubled and fascinating main character played by jean-pierre léaud who is trapped between two no three women we listen to his social philosophical and moral idiosyncrasies in interminable monologues we see him working his magic around the three women that he loves this could be the premise for a fowl movie full of rigid cold uninteresting commentaries yet director jean eustache manages to keep it fresh ironic and witty being such a long movie one cannot but burst into laughing when after hours of speaking politely jean-pierre léaud all of a sudden screams on the phone while he remembers a cheesy line from a movie this kind of situations are purely cinematographic and cannot be fully restored in a commentary nor can someone restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue of françoise lebrun towards the end of the movie and hours and worthing every minute 	POS

i don t understand your objections to this movie it is a taut thrilling extension of the character created in basic instinct the only part of the story that is the least bit unrealistic is the fact that sharon stone s character is still alive and not in jail at this late date spoiler alert: as the movie progresses we are presented with three theories of what is going on: sharon stone s character is killing all these people because she s crazy risk addicted ; david thewlis crooked cop is killing these people in order to frame sharon stone s character; david morrissey s analyst is killing these people for revenge what upsets most people about the movie seems to be that none of these theories are ever explicated as the real story although the analyst is in a psychiatric care facility for killing the cop; the only killing that occurs on screen i think this is a brilliant plot device in the spirit of a space odyssey who cares what is real the blonde really is crazy the cop really is crooked and the analyst really wants revenge what s important is the interactions between these and other characters in the story like real life everyone is more complicated than anyone thinks and reality is more complicated than a movie get over it 	POS
i saw a special advance screening of this today i have to let you know i m not a huge fan of either dane cook or steve carell so i really had no expectations going into this i ended up enjoying it quite a bit dan in real life is the story of a widower with daughters who goes to spend a weekend with his family while at a bookstore he meets the woman of his dreams only to find out that she happens to be his brother s girlfriend this movie is pretty well made- the soundtrack cinematography and acting are all top-notch especially steve carell my problem with it was mostly that there seemed to be a lack of character development mostly with dane cook s character we never really get a close look at the relationship between dane and steve s characters and i felt that it could have helped a bit in showing what dan s inner conflict about being in love with dane s girlfriend was like other than this though dan in real life is definitely a solid sweet film- definitely a nice break from all the horror and action movies we ve been getting this year 	POS
the father of the who s alcoholic drummer keith moon was named arthur i found so many similarities between dudley moore and keith moon in this movie liza minelli who usually overacts did quite a good job in this one and was able to turn cheek on dudley moore in every turn yes i agree sir john stole absolutely every scene it was a very different movie enabling the viewer to have a glimpse into another life we often try to catch a rerun of this movie on satellite god rest dudley moore; this was such an enjoyable movie much satire and thumbs down to the rich and snobby affluent the close friendship between moore and sir john is rather endearing 	POS
what i loved about the on-screen adaptation of the stone angel is that it stayed so true to the novel great film as an avid reader i find the worst thing about film adaptations is that the book somehow gets lost in translation you can tell the stone angel team was careful not to let this happen with this film ellen burstyn was an excellent casting choice for the role of hagar and she is definitely a movie superstar however i think the canadian actress christine horne chosen to play hagar in her younger years also did an incredible job that warrants great praise i haven t seen any of horne s previous work but i will definitely seek it out after seeing her stone angel performance i heard the canadian theatrical release of the stone angel is going to happen in spring or summer i can t wait to see it on the big screen again 	POS

like talk radio the booth is actually kinda predictable talk radio because we know the truth of what happened going in the booth because of- let s face it- the genre and the basic set-up that s not necessarily a bad thing in this case it means in essence that the filmmakers don t punk out in the end the way they might ve in say an american version of this story the booth moves inexorably toward its foregone conclusion but is so beautifully crafted on every level that one can enjoy the ride the way one might a familiar cruise along a well-travelled stretch of very scenic road it reminds me of harlan ellison s spooky short story flop sweat the claustrophobia is at times almost palpable worth a nice long look 	POS
i have to admit i have always found it difficult to watch an antonioni film from start to finish at the first try and even for this one i ended up watching it in three parts on repeated occasions in the end i realised perhaps it was better that way because it forced me to stop thinking in the usual terms of plot and just enjoy the scenes one by one the first part seems a lot more fragmentary which is not a bad thing it just requires more of an effort to follow when it gets to the desert scenes all efforts are repaid in full the stunning cinematography is only a part of it what really makes it all unforgettable is how the landscape is made into an overwhelming presence the silence and vastness of it the sense of sadness and freedom the way it fuses and contrasts with the two young characters the desert is dead but at the same time it feels less distant and alien than the urban scenes in the first part the dance between the airplane flying over and the girl s car makes for a series of great shots the love scenes in the desert are simply beautiful it is hard to imagine this kind of approach from a film of our times there is of course something very stylish and studied about them but at the same time they manage to express a sense of natural spontaneous innocence that is very rare these days it all feels loose and unscripted thanks also to the understated acting but that is the result of a maniacal attention to detail and form which comes to its climax in the series of explosions at the end a really mesmerising spectacle it just leaves you in awe i don t really care for some the usual objections: boring - well yes it is if you want all films to follow a classic plot development and be packed with action twists but then if all cinema was like that that would be truly dull and sad; pretentious - maybe but when that kind of ambitiousness is coupled with actual skills depth and style pretentious is a compliment the political criticisms make the least sense to me i don t see the point of approaching a film like this with ideological blinders or worse patriotic requirements it just defeats the purpose perhaps it s true that like a previous commenter remarked antonioni viewed these young hippies and the politics of protests and riots with the police with the fascination of a foreigner but i think that adds something rather than detracting from the film it s not true that hippies did not exist in italy at the time think of the protests like in france although they were obviously different from the american counterpart and in some ways even more militant but his interest in this film was not narrowly political the events seem more like a pretext for a film whose appeal has a universal timeless quality a special mention for the fantastic soundtrack amongst other things this film along with easy rider is probably one of the main earliest precursors of the contemporary artsy music video as well as the concept of a film soundtrack that would stand on its own but unlike the former it uses music in a much more subtle way blending it with the landscape rather than the action if you want traditional narrative in a film then don t bother if you want to be stunned be patient and you won t regret it 	POS

the first two sequences of this movie set up the two conflicts: the -thematic- conflict between the soldier todd and his suppressed humanity and the -physical- conflict between todd and his bio-engineered replacement both sequences are quite gripping in different ways peoples screenplay falters somewhat by resolving the first of these arcs half-way through the movie which means the second half is little more than a straightforward action romp nonetheless kudos to the makers for creating an genre action piece with heart and even a bit of soul and especially to kurt russell who conveys much with very little not a great film but one worth seeing 	POS

what happens when the average joe finds out he has supernatural powers the premise may sound familiar the watchmen unbreakable however the russian sci-fi action flick the sword bearer is far from the standard stock the story revolves around a man named sasha who as a boy was shunned from society his peers and family due to a supernatural power that he possess when he wishes or his anger allows a sword extends from his arm piercing his own skin very wolverinish maybe but that s not the interesting part of this film shunned all his life and driven by anger and a temper he does have our hero returns to his home town to turn his life around or find a reason to the only thing he encounters here is trouble when an encounter with an old flame s new boyfriend leaves him bloodied on the ground this is where the vengeance and anger comes into play this is a man you do not want to cross and from this point the mafia and the police are on his tail he meets a girl and falls in love instantly as does she and this is really what the movie is about the film is highly impressionistic with bold colors and noir overtones spliced with short yet extreme action sequences this is art house at it s core beautifully filmed with such attention to details in every scene over gruesome sci-fi action it s this odd mash that interests me so much in this film the directors approach for this genre is refreshing focusing on the emotional journey of sasha and not a straight action film don t worry though the action is there and plenty of it however much of these sequences show only implied violence with pictures of the horrific aftermath this is not to say that action is not shown these scenes are here and are fantastic especially the ending where we see sasha s full powers unleashed in desperation the director chooses to imply the violence of many scenes to keep the focus on the character s emotional struggle at hand this is a tragic love story and a refreshing entry into the genre 	POS
most of the bad reviews on this website blame hood of the living dead for one or more of the following reasons: it is a low-budget movie with virtually no acting; it was so bad it made me laugh it is something i could do myself i won t even discuss the first point because it is a very subjective matter whether you like low-budget and independent stuff or not i must say however that i still fail to understand people renting such a movie as hood of the living dead and then looking surprised when they realize it is not as polished and cute as a romantic comedy with lindsay lohan or matthew mc conaughey as for the second point i really don t see what s so wrong with laughing i personally like to laugh and love movies that make me to be they comedies or horror flicks when in hammerhead i saw this girl stepping into a puddle and the shark-man came out of it to eat her i just cracked up and i was grateful that the director made such a stupid scene and gave me ten seconds of pure fun honestly laughing just makes me feel good while it seems that many people writing reviews see it as a bad bad thing if you only want to feel sad and scared while watching a movie hood of the living dead and low-budget flicks are definitely not for you but please don t come and tell us that you find them laughable we already know it this is most probably why we decided to watch the movie in first place however it is the third point that leaves totally baffled just several years ago people were lining up out of theaters to see blair witch project which is a way more rudimentary boring plot-less and bad-acted movie than hood of the living dead and takes itself way too seriously too moreover half a million people go on youtube every day to see the short films of lonelygirl which is certainly something everyone with a cute girlfriend a room and a webcam could do not to talk about all of the even more amateurish videos you can find there why don t people blame those clips for bad acting and non-existing plot i think it is one of the best things of our times that everyone with affordable technology and a bunch of friends can make their own movies and share them with people that have similar interests and i feel a certain admiration for people who spend their weekends with their friends making a honestly bad yet refreshing piece of trash like this rather than shopping at the mall or playing video games alone leave aside your biases and your desire to sound like a smart film critic by attacking b-movies and you ll see that hood of the living dead can bring you almost as much fun as it did to its makers if you have a taste for refreshing and enjoyable home-made horror movies i recommend zombiez the ghosts of edendale the killer eye monster man don t look in the basement the worst horror movie ever made redneck zombies jesus christ vampyre-slayer and habit 	POS

the fourth man paul verhoeven - netherlands a film based on a novella by gerard reve that works best as a thriller that s quite surprising considering reve roughly needs a hundred pages for just a minor plot twist and tension is the last thing on my mind when reading his work the fourth man is top-heavy on symbolism paul verhoeven is generally extremely preoccupied with proving something to mostly hostile critics and i m never sure what it is exactly he is trying to prove he usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in such an unsubtle way he quickly diverges from the original idea or storyline and almost seems to forget what needs to be seen on screen and what needs to be left out in the fourth man he is not as explicit on detailing the plot as he is with sex and nudity of which there s plenty but as in most of his films he seems afraid the audience wouldn t get it and hammers home the story with overt symbolism mixed with some supposedly shocking nudity and graphic sex scenes there s hardly a scene without sex or full-frontal nudity most of it so maddeningly gratuitous and in your face it undermines an otherwise good story nevertheless when you can cope with verhoeven s pretty obvious satiric approach it s quite an entertaining thriller at times with some intriguing plot twists and good performances all round thom hoffman and jeroen krabbé in particular camera obscura --- 	POS
admittedly i know nothing about baseball i m not even a fan of the sport but that didn t stop me enjoying the farrelly brothers latest film fever pitch a charmingly irreverent romantic comedy the film is not really about baseball; rather it s really about relationships and the emotional disconnectedness that can often take place jimmy fallen  giving his best performance to date  stars as ben a dorky lightly nerdy schoolteacher ben is a kind of man-boy who unfortunately has never really grown up and he fosters an almost fanatical addiction to the red sox baseball team ben has devoted his life to the sox and does everything from making the pilgrimage to florida for spring training to decorating every square inch of his apartment in team paraphernalia one day while taking his honors geometry class to on a field trip to her office ben meets the go-getting lindsey a wonderful drew barrymore lindsey is a corporate career orientated kind of girl but she has a kind of cuteness that ben finds totally endearing he s initially hesitant to ask her out thinking that she s way out of his class and lindsey doesn t immediately see a potential partner in ben their first date gets off to a disastrous start when lindsey is stricken with a severe case of food poisoning  and her resonant retching provides the first clue that we are in fact watching a farrelly brothers movie rather than accept lindsey s - rather urgent - request to reschedule ben sticks around to play nurse orderly and janitor so ben scrubs the toilet and the dog s teeth while his love interest is passed out with a bucket next to her bed when lindsey wakes up in the morning and finds him asleep on her couch she begins the long fitful process of dismantling the web of status anxiety and ambition she has come to think of as her standards soon they are falling in love with lindsey blithely accepting ben s fanatical devotion to his sport having inherited choice season tickets from his beloved uncle ben has organized his life around the season  he s never missed a game but their relationship which has progressed without a hitch throughout the winter hits a snag at the start of the season lindsey wants ben to do other things like holiday with her parents and party with her friends but ben begins to have trouble modulating his interest to meet lindsey halfway can lindsey consent to his irrational devotion to the boys of summer in order to make their relationship work can she really accommodate ben s infatuation with sports can a die-hard and nerdy red sox fan find true love after all of course lindsey and ben come with a colorful assortment of opinion-wielding friends lindsey s strictest buddy the skinny rich and blond robin kadee strickland insists that there must be something wrong with the guy if he s still single at however plump curly-haired sarah marissa jaret winokur and molly ione skye supply a more optimistic and positive view of ben ben s eccentricity could be applied to virtually any obsessive sports fan while lindsay s frustrations could be representative of any upwardly mobile career driven woman fallon is terrific as ben exhibiting real big screen potential overcoming the not-insignificant challenge of keeping ben from being unsympathetic barrymore meanwhile is equally charming as the workaholic lindsey particularly as she struggles to accept ben for who he is without losing sight of her own needs fever pitch really works and even though there are lots of inspired comedic moments the movie is also addressing the serious problem of sports addiction and how difficult it can be for couples to negotiate this fragile territory much of the movie was filmed at boston s fenway park which adds a fine sense of authenticity to the proceedings as well as the ambiance of the games though fully appreciating what transpired with the team will probably be limited to baseball aficionados even so fever pitch is blessed with such a finely wrought and intelligently funny script that even novice baseball fans will find much with which to connect mike leonard september 	POS
this series adds new information and background to the book and includes personal appearances by the author and by archaeologists and other anthropologists it brings the book to life and makes even more sense of the author s subsequent opus collapse diamond himself comes off as personable and caring not just a disinterested or disengaged academic this series makes it clear that his book was not just a response to a need to publish or perish as the saying goes about academe but a deeply considered answer to a question from someone he respects why you white people got so much cargo and we have so little because he respected the intelligence of the questioner and his community diamond looked for an answer that didn t insult that intelligence or that community i like to think of his answer in a very simple way in the same spirit as south park s blame canada : blame wheat 	POS
i was pleased to see that she had black hair i ve been a fan for about years now and have been disgusted at the two earlier attempts to film the stories i was pleased that the screenwriters updated the period to include a computer it didn t spoil it at all in fact i watched the film twice in one day a sure sign that it was up to standard this is what i do with books that i like as well i thought all the characters were well depicted and represented the early days of modesty blaise extremely well as evinced in both book and comic strip i would also have to disagree with a comment made by an earlier reviewer about baddies having to be ugly has he actually read the books i thought this was a very good film and look forward to sequels with anticipation 	POS
seeing this movie was the most fun i ve had at the cinema in a long time however i am not able to say whether this is a good or a bad film because such simple qualifications simply cannot be applied this picture has everything any movie could ever have it has characteristics of a romantic comedy a political commentary a thriller a drama an action movie a musical and an absurdist self-conscious art film it s all in there adding up to a myth the basic premise is about an indian couple nandini karishma kapoor and shekhar sanjay kapoor happily living in canada who rush to india to visit the husband s parents after a disturbing news report the rest of the story takes place in india where the couple find themselves in the midst of a plot of fratricidal violence at one point the story borrows from not without my baby but to call shakti a remake of anything would be an injustice the ostensible story line takes a backseat to a number of astonishing interruptions including shah rukh khan s dream of aishwarya rai which comes as if out of another movie in fact the two stars are on all the posters but they appear really late in the film and only shah rukh ends up being a real character yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performance karishma kapoor is the one with most work to do in this film and she does an admirable job having to link up the film s twists and turns with a show of believable emotion another notable presence is nana patekar who plays narsimha the tyrannical father of the husband shekhar nana patekar dominates every scene he s in with a scary but nuanced character the movie is not without its share of realism violence is rampant but truly disturbing in the abuse received by most of the female characters with karishma getting soundly beaten on a number of occasions at times this violence is clearly disturbing but ultimately it becomes surreal as every dramatic sequence is usually followed by such comic and spectacular turns that the overall effect is nothing but cathartic i have seen a share of bollywood releases and the mixing of genres and incredible plot resolutions are certainly their norm but shakti raises the bar by absorbing an even greater masala without becoming ridiculous it is a film that achieves the grandeur of a shakespearian tragedy where the audience of the rabble and royalty is equally entertained it is pure gratuitous cinema and the director krishna vamsi must have had a dream of a good time by throwing in every trick in the book perhaps the all-important message of violence begetting violence and the inspiring extents of motherly love were not the thoughts on my mind but i came out of watching shakti exhilarated making movies can be the most fun in the world 	POS
although super mario isn t like the rest of the games in the series it is still a classic and is every bit as good as the old games games with this much replay value are few and far between plus this game has so much variety there are levels each with several different tasks you can do and many other hidden tasks the game isn t very challenging but its lack of challenge doesn t take away from the game at all once you beat it you ll want to erase your game and start again and its just as much fun the second time or third time or two hundredth time a must own for any nintendo owner and is a reason in itself to own a nintendo 	POS

one of the greatest film i have seen this year last maybe before sun rise which is also seen late at night alone in the lab i like the idea of the film which suggest free will of man and our weakness against fate with time past by james and kathryn are destined to fail and an indescribable sorrow comes i do like the end but a big question also comes the virus shall not be released again should it in the last scene in the airport jose is sent back to meet james again by future scientists when he tell him that scientists had already got his message and know someone else would spread the virus and they two together meet kathryn when kathryn tell james the true man is dr goines assistant so it is clearly jose also get the true information about the virus james keep an eye on him at the time remember and he has teeth so why everything is still happen why future scientists don t do anything after the truth is revealed my biggest question after the film 	POS

rawhide was a wonderful tv western series focusing on a band of trail drovers lead by the trail boss gil favor most episodes - especially from the first seasons were really character studies of favor and his men guest stars came and went but unlike wagon train they seldom dominated the episodes they appeared in rawhide was a true gritty western and gil favor stood out as a memorable character never to be forgotten thanks to eric fleming s performance the show became a massive hit of course he was ably supported by a wonderful cast of good actors - clint eastwood sheb wooley paul brinegar steve raines james murdoch rocky shahan robert cabal all of these actors left their mark in a piece of television history rawhide captured the flavour of that time of the west that no other series has for me as yet anyhow managed to do so later seasons tended to split the leads and give them individual story lines for me some of the time this didn t work - the cattle drive and the regulars provided the best stories however there were still some classic stories and rawhide remained top drawer affair the black and white photography added to a bleak realistic feel that other western series seldom managed to capture rustlers indians commancheroes beautiful damsels in distress serial killers they all showed up to give our heroes problems the end came for the series quietly when the final season was axed less than half way through the reason - eric fleming had departed and rawhide was now a head without a body - the gritty realism was gone gil favor commanded respect and exuded authority - he was never infallible and this made him all the more interesting we shall not see his like again watch an episode whenever you can they seldom disappoint 	POS

i loves this movie because it showed that they were not killing for fun but to save the ones they loved heath ledger and orlando bloom did a great job portraying ned and joe it has a few quick inappropriate scenes but is all right other than that the language is very mild and sometimes don t even know it is there this movie shows that just because they are outlaws does not mean that they are vicious killers i hope that people will watch this movie and learn about important times in history like this one there is one thing that fascinates me about this movie is that they got their inspiration for their armor from a book ned looked at also that that is how people remember them from their armor i hope that people will watch this movie and get interested as i have 	POS
it s remarkable that for young mr lincoln s supporting players ford cast lesser known other-than-star actors this not only heightens his film s focus on the central character of lincoln but it also affords the audience a refreshing insight into lincoln as a man of his place and time a man embroiled as each one of us inexorably is in the issues and sentiments of his time and seeking his way to resolving them it s not so much through fonda s lincoln s words and actions but in the faces the reactions of the supporting players that ford tells the story of the formation of the young lincoln s worldview sense of place in society and polity and of how the people responded to mr lincoln s words and deeds and placed their trust in this man whom they deemed to have earned their respect and heeding give this a try: instead of focusing on henry fonda next time you view young mr lincoln shift your focus to the supporting characters - you will i expect be handsomely rewarded with a more profound appreciation of both lincoln and ford i like to suspect that ford s storytelling through the supporting characters reactions to fonda s lincoln may have appealed to david lean when he directed omar sharif in doctor zhivago in which it s the supporting characters reactions to zhivago that actually tell about zhivago 	POS
the problem with the version of this movie is simple; indiana jones was so closely modeled after alan quartermain or at least is an alan quartermain type of character that the director made the mistake of plundering the ij movies for dialog and story far too deeply what you got as a finished product was a jumbled mess of the name alan quartermain in an uneven hodge podge of a cheaply imitated ij saga with a touch of austin powers-esquire cheese here and there it was labeled by many critics to have been a great parody or unintentional comedy unintentional is the word this movie was never intended to be humorous; witty yes but not humorous unfortunately it s witless rather than witty with this new m tv mini-series you get much more story character development of your lead solid portrayals and a fine even entertaining blend this story is a bit long; much longer than its predecessors but deservedly so as this version carries a real storyline and not just action and eye candy while it features both action and eye candy it also corrects the mistake made in the version by forgetting ij all together and going back to the source materials for aq making for a fine well - thought - out plot and some nice complementing sub-plots now this attempt is not the all out action-extravaganza that is indiana jones nor is it a poor attempt to be so this vehicle is plot and character driven and is a beautiful rendition of the aq ksm saga filmed on location in south africa the audience is granted beautiful if desolate vistas sa aboriginal cultures and some nice wildlife footage to blend smoothly with the performances and storyline here steve boyum totally surprised me with this one as i have never been one to subscribe to his vision in fact i have disliked most of his work as a director until this attempt i hope this is more a new vein of talent and less the fluke that it seems to be this version rates a on the tv scale from the fiend : 	POS

 emma was a product of what might be called by the first great jane austen cycle of the mid-nineties and it was recently shown on british television doubtless because of the interest in the author created by the second great jane austen cycle which started with pride and prejudice two years ago we currently have in the cinemas the austen biopic becoming jane and itv have recently produced three tv movies based on austen novels these include northanger abbey the only one of the six major novels not to have been filmed previously so the cycle should now be complete no doubt however there will be more to come in the near future there is after all her juvenile love and freindship sic the short novella lady susan and someone somewhere has doubtless supplied endings to her two unfinished fragments the watsons and sanditon then there are all those austen sequels churned out by modern writers the main character is emma woodhouse a young lady from an aristocratic family in regency england not as some reviewers have assumed victorian england- austen died before queen victoria was even born emma is financially considerably better off than most austen heroines such as elizabeth bennett or fanny price and has no need to find herself a wealthy husband instead her main preoccupation seems to be finding husbands for her friends she persuades her friend harriet to turn down a proposal of marriage from a young farmer robert martin believing that harriet should be setting her sights on the ambitious clergyman mr elton this scheme goes disastrously wrong however as elton has no interest in harriet but has fallen in love with emma herself the speed with which emma rejects his proposal makes one wonder just why she was so keen to match her friend with a man she regards with good reason as an unsuitable marriage partner for herself this being a jane austen plot emma turns out to be less of a committed spinster than she seems and she too finds herself falling in love leading to further complications emma always insists that she will not marry without affection and when she does find a partner the handsome mr knightley we feel that this will indeed be an affectionate marriage it does not however seem likely to be a very passionate one unlike say that of elizabeth bennett and mr darcy knightley who is sixteen years older than emma she is he and related to her by marriage is more like a father-figure than a lover much more of a father-figure in fact than her actual father a querulous and selfish old hypochondriac who seems more like her grandfather when emma is rude to her unbearably garrulous and tedious friend miss bates it is knightley who chides her for her lack of manners his surname is probably meant to indicate his gentlemanly nature- nineteenth-century gentlemen liked to think of themselves as the modern equivalent of mediaeval knights with their elaborate codes of chivalry both gwyneth paltrow and jeremy northam play their parts very well but this is not really one of the great screen romances of the other characters i liked juliet stephenson s vulgar mrs elton and toni collette s harriet i know that in the novel harriet was a naïve young teenager whereas here she is more like the character collette played in muriel s wedding - a gauche slightly overweight twentysomething fretting about her chances of finding a man nevertheless i felt that this characterisation worked well in the context of the film and did not detract from austen s themes emma is one of austen s more light-hearted works without the darker overtones of mansfield park or even pride and prejudice and this is reflected on screen we see a world of beauty and grace full of stately homes and elegant costumes and fine manners apart from the ruffianly gypsies who make a very brief appearance the only poor people we see are mrs bates and her daughter and as they live in the sort of picturesque rose-strewn thatched cottage which today would change hands for over £ we can be sure that their poverty is relative not absolute in emma s world poverty is defined as not having your own stately home this is of course not a comprehensive picture of early nineteenth-century life but nobody has ever claimed austen as the regency equivalent of a kitchen-sink realist sophisticated romantic comedy combined with a keen eye for analysing human character was more in her line i would not rate this film quite as highly as the sense and sensibility or the recent pride and prejudice - it tends to drag a bit in the middle although it has a strong beginning and strong ending- but it is in the main a highly enjoyable austen adaptation 	POS

evening is the beautiful story of the flawed love of a mother the movie split in time is magically shot amazingly acted and has a touching script vanessa redgrave plays anne grant lord a woman sun-setting out of life lying in her bed her mind remembering and misfiring she recalls her first mistake claire danes plays the young anne giving a youthful vitality to dying bed ridden woman daughters nina toni collette and constance natasha richardson try to decipher the real story from the disheartening dementia her first mistake revolves around harris arden patrick wilson ; the man her best friend lila mamie gummer deeply loved the daughters must come to terms with their mother s past and their futures the cast is glowing in evening the collective acting energy of this movie could have powered the equipment for the production of this entire film i am so glad to see claire danes working again especially in this role she is so young and alive fully living the joys mistakes and heartbreak of young anne s first mistake this is a true feat when you realize she is playing a woman dying in bed when her life overwhelms her you can feel her desire to crack and her hopeless hope that she won t some of her facial expressions grinded on me a little but over all her performance was so radiant i was left with that only as a side note toni collette continues to prove that you can be a powerful actress without being a super model she plays the black sheep of the family; a little lost nina finds a great deal of strength in her mother s mistake collette delicately avoids creating a cruel character who revels in the mistakes of her mother instead choosing the wiser path of learning from her mother s mistakes there is a great deal of infighting between nina and her sister constance their fights remind me of ones i have with my sister all the time mamie gummer who plays anne s youthful best friend is wonderful her character is stuck between her heart and her status in society even when she is crying and her heart is breaking she is incredibly regal and charming i can t wait to see her act in something else in the future vanessa redgrave s performance is very hard for me to describe her talent at making her mental status ambiguous without being wacko or even especially tragic is why it is so powerful the audience does not know if she is making up the story because she is slipping away or if these events truly happened physically and emotionally speaking redgrave is acting in a box not much physical space and limited emotional range might have been a stunner to a lesser actress but she makes the limitations work for her i was constantly amazed the movie is definitely woman-focused but the men in the movie are not just accessories patrick wilson is mesmerizing as harris it is no wonder that everyone in the movie is in love with him i sure was buddy wittenborn is lila s brother spiraling out of control hugh dancy spirals buddy out of control without sending his acting down the drain glen close has my favorite scene in the movie it reminded me of the famous scene from monster s ball it is terrible and jaw dropping grief i was utterly stunned the one acting disappointment was natasha richardson while her fight scenes were memorable most of her acting reeks of melodrama it would have suited her to take an acting bath before we had to breathe her stink it s a good thing she wasn t in charge of the visuals the visuals of the movie are sparkling cinematographer gyula pados couldn t make a film richer in color light so perfectly matched to mood and emotion the visual concepts of the flash back sequences are powerful and resonating there were many scenes that could have been stopped printed mounted and sold as art i admit it i cried evening is a powerful movie evening is defiantly a chick flick but a really great chick flick if you want to impress a woman with a movie choice pick evening 	POS
not to be confused with the resse witherspoon high school film of the same name this is a stylised look at hong kong s triad gangs called election because a new leader or chairman is elected by ancient traditions every two years two candidates are up for the position and through ego bribes and past track record the race is tense to say the least expertly directed to introduce you to an expansive cast without ever being confusing the story twists and turns before revealing itself in all its brutal glory the asian godfather this is not but it is an enjoyable thriller in a gangster genre that will leave you on the edge of your seat and wincing at the violence subtitled volume i think its safe to say there will other instalments as we go deeper into the murky world of the triads and all their feuding and underhand business deals either way this is a good start and if there are no sequels a great film in its own right 	POS
this was a great movie that had a lot of under lying issues it dealt with issues of rascism and class but it also had a message of knowing yourself and taking responsibility for yourself this movie was very deep it gave the message of that you and only you can control your destiny it also showed that knowing yourself and being comfortable with who you are is the only way you will ever fit into society what others think of you is not important i believe this movie did a wonderful job of showing it the actors i think were able to convey each character wonderfully i just thought it was amazing how deep this movie really was at a just glancing look you wouldn t see how deep the movie is but on further look you see the underlining meaning of the movie 	POS
while i was the video store i was browsing through the one dollar rentals and came upon this little gem i don t know what it was about it but i just had a gut instic about it and wow was i ever right the story centers around two girls who have just survived a school shooting one of the girls is alicia a teenage reble who is the only witness for the full attack and another is deanna another survivor who survived a bullet to the head by some miracle thrown together by fate they slowly begin a painful and beautiful display of healing and moving on i just hate it when amazing movies fall through the cracks because wow what a performance by busy phillips and erkia christensen not to mention the rest of the cast my only complaint is that the dvd was sorely lacking in special features oh and some of the jump cuts in the movie were kind of jarring but all in all a excellent movie 	POS
peter jacksons version s are better films overall from objective point of view that being said they are not my favorite screen versions of lord of the rings and let me explain why firstly the acting of the on-screen characters is just too ordinary and uninspiring with jackson s lotr the whole cast is too run of the mill are you claiming that those silly cartoon characters of ralph bakshi version are better actors than real people one could ask well they are not really silly save for hobbits later about them and they certainly pack more personality than jackson s party - even with much more limited dialogue time and that is because of superior _voice_ acting of the bakshi s lotr take aragorn for example in this version his voice is deep and charismatic with full of authority aragorn the lord and with a seasoned rasp aragorn the ranger this is due to john hurt s brilliant voice acting compare that to viggo mortensen s rather high pitched sound with no soul and the duel gets quickly uneven: hurt beats mortensen hands down and then there is gandalf probably the most dominating and the most popular character in the whole saga in this bakshi version gandalf william squire is a real wizard and by that i don t mean he shoots bolts from his fingertips he does not but his presence is just captivating he is a mystical powerful and can switch from gentle old man to a scary person with ease add to that his looks: tall old as the ancient oak beard long as his body sharp eyes wizardy hook nose and of course the classical wizard hat a perfect gandalf just like in the books ian mckellen s gandalf in the other hand is simply just too boring he looks too human sounds too human acts too human and wears no hat or wields no sword yes a sword in this bakshi version gandalf scores couple of bloody orc kills with his sword as he did in the books and those are stylish slow motion kills gandalf is not a power to be messed with and it must be noted that while i m sad to say this the great christopher lee didn t bring saruman alive fraser kerr in this movie did even with a very limited screen time and lines before i move completely to visual aspects of the movie it must be mentioned that the voice acting and the general presenation of the orcs are also superior to jackson s pretendeous bad guys bakshi s orcs taunt their enemies or each other constantly with growls screams and nasty language they are more believable as monsters and are more faithful to the book in my opinion and finally the black riders - or the nazgul those ultimate bad guys are scary ghosts in this one - not just some riders wearing black and they speak with haunting voice which mesmerizes their victim my favorite scene in the film is when the nazgul are chasing frodo near the river while peter jackson couldn t do anything but show the riders simply chasing the party bakshi throws in a nightmarish dream with some cool slow motion scenes and thundering sky but as much i like this film more than jackson s the latter are if only technically still better and that is because of some key visuals as you know bakshi lotr features a mixture of animated characters all hobbits and the main cast and real actors covered with paint i don t really have a problem using real people in animation this way but they just don t fit very well with traditional cartoon figures this is especially true with humans riders of rohan tavern people etc orcs are different matter since they are meant to look very distinctive from other characters orcs while played by humans with animation mix look far superior to jacksons version they have brownish-green skin shiny red eyes flat face and pointed teeth biggest screw up in this films visuals howerver are the hobbits while i prefer almost every character in bakshi version compared to jackson the latter has clearly superior hobbits in fact they are perfect with bakshi you get some irritating and rather poorly drawn humanoid disney bambies and you are forced to spend a lot of movie time with them so be warned again the voice acting is ok with them too but the actors mouths cannot save the immersion damage made by these little weasels well i never really liked those halflings anyway general failures in the bakshi script are well known limited playing time with limited budget and a lot of missing scenes so while this film covers nearly half of the story it doesn t do it in extensive detail compared to jackson s version in a summary the ralph bakshi version of lotr has a superior:-overall atmosphere it feels more like middle-earth -overall voice acting -music i really dig the fantasy score by kont & rosenman -gandalf -aragorn one of the john hurt s finest roles -king theoden -orcs -black riders -elrond he s not some fairy hippie in this one while jackson version is better:-because it covers the whole story -overall visuals and special effects -gollum smeagol -balrog -hobbitslord of the rings by ralph bakshi even with it s well known shortcomings is one of the best animation films ever made and it captures the atmosphere of tolkien s fantasy world very well if not perfectly i ll give it a score of ½ out of 	POS
i happened to catch this movie on cable one afternoon i have to admit that i ve never been a big baseball fan but i can sometimes get into a good sports-related movie what i found more interesting was the depiction of the foster family system as a therapist who has seen both the good and the bad of the community mental health and foster system i though it was rather refreshing to see a movie that showed both the ups and downs of this system: people jumping from family to family biological parents not always taking an active involvement and transitions that can be but heart-wrenching and heart-melting joseph gordon-levitt and danny glover are the anchor of this film and both bring very believable performances maybe it was just my emotional state but i did find myself shedding a tear at the end of the film 	POS
i was amazed at the improvements made in an animated film if you sit close to the screen you will see the detail in the grass and surface structures the detail colors and shading are at least an order of magnitude better than toy story how they were able to pull off the shading i will never know i do hope that pixar will provide a documentary on how the film was produced so i can find out how all this was accomplished based on this film i think animated films of the future will be judged on the basis of this film 	POS
william h macy is at his most sympathetic and compelling here as a hit-man and loving father who wants to step out of the family business without angering his overbearing parents treads much of the same territory as tv s the sopranos in terms of the mid-life crisis of a criminal theme here too he visits a shrink but is still worth watching thanks to some taut direction from brommel i look forward to what this guy directs next an excellent script and all around great performances macy is excellent as always this is probably his best role since fargo donald sutherland is at his creepy best as the domineering father tracy ullman gives a surprisingly riveting dramatic turn as macy s wife young david dorfman is excellent as macy s bright and sensitive son many of his lines sound ad-libbed and are wonderful even neve campell who i usually find abhorrent is compelling as the troubled young woman who captures macy s eye all of this is punctuated by a moving score and crisp pace that lead up to a predictable but still powerful climax and meaningful and touching aftermath this film deserved a much wider release as i suspect it would have connected with audiences 	POS
 mechenosets is one of the most beautiful romantic movies i ve ever seen the name of the film can be translated in english as the sword-bearer the main hero sasha was born with one exceptional ability: he can protect himself with the extremely sharp sword which emerges from under the skin in his hand at first side he can seem one more foolish superhero from the senseless movie about unreal events and feelings but it is not about mechenosets he hardly can be even called the anti-hero i think he is just a person who lost the purport in his life and faith in good justice and love in his life he has never met someone who could understand and love him except his mother every his step is stained with blood; he takes revenge on everybody for his gift which became a damnation for him and suddenly he meets her she doesn t need the idle talks and explanations she loves him for what he is she doesn t care what he did the fact that he s next to her is more important than anything else but soon she finds out his secret: he kills two people her ex-boyfriend and his bodyguard to protect her before her very eyes even after that she couldn t escape her feelings they try to run but it s hart to hide finally they have a serious car accident he is caged; she is in a mental hospital they don t know anything about each other but she believes that he ll save her he surmounts a lot of obstacles but finally finds her they run again but they aren t invulnerable she is wounded she needs a rest but police almost catch them he doesn t know what to do they drive into a corner and then his sword begins to cut down trees helicopter around them but there is no need for it because she is already dead in his arms and he is the lonely person in the whole world again 	POS

i strongly disagree with ctomvelu regarding jim belushi s talent i happen to like belushi very much admittedly i was skeptical when he first appeared on the scene because i was such a huge fan of his late brother john but jim has an on-screen charm that has gotten him very far -- and he has developed it well over the years curly sue is one of his earlier films -- his weight is a giveaway ain t that true for most of us -- and i like the film yes it is touching and heartwarming so if you re into car chases explosions and gratuitous sex then you might want to pass on this one -- it is a warm film of three lost soles who find each other don t get me wrong i am all for the three aforementioned keys to a successful film but i also like a nice solid tale like this one and although belushi and kelly lynch deliver excellent performances the real star of this film is alisan porter -- who is absolutely adorable i don t know what happened to her career but whoever is responsible for dropping the ball agent parents herself should be shot you couldn t ask for a more perfect introduction to fame than this film and yet nothing of note has been heard from her since another sad hollywood story 	POS

this movie came and went in the theaters due to the nature of it you can see why it wasn t well received it was unfairly panned because of its subject matter more than the actual film itself higher learning is not spectacular but it was good film that tried to talk about a feared subject in america: racism plot story: higher learning is mostly centered around malik played by omar epps a naive track star who is has to deal with not being fast enough and a stern professor played by laurence fishburne he befriends fudge ice cube as well as a gorgeous lady named deja tyra banks later on they end up having to deal with some skinheads on campus remy play by michael rapaport is confused kid who ends up befriending some local skinheads on campus once they impose their views on him he becomes as racist as they are opinion: higher learning is not without its flaws: character development is scarce okay performances by omar epps tyra banks and the leader of the skinheads whose name i forgot busta rhymes doesn t fit in this movie at all plus women turning gay after being abused by men was cliché before this film so you know i didn t like that part of the film with kristy swanson other than that this movie wasn t half bad laurence fishburne was good as professor phipps even though i could do without the accent fudge was ice cube s best performance and michael rapaport was good as the confused remy all in all it was one of john singleton s best movies and is one is one of the reasons i frown on the rubbish he puts out now cinema needs more movies like higher learning mississippi burning and american history x and less movies like baby boy fast furious and a very pointless remake of shaft 	POS
i enjoyed the innocence of this film and how the characters had to deal with the reality of having a powerful animal in their midst the gorilla looks just terrific and the eyes were especially lifelike it s even a little scary at times and should have children slightly frightened without going over the top rene russo plays her role wonderfully feminine usually these type of hollywood films that take place in the past feel the need to create a straw-man villain but the only adversary is the gorilla it s an interesting look at how close some animals are to humans how they feel the same emotions we do and yet how we really can t treat them just like people because they aren t not many films venture into this territory and it s worth seeing if you want to contemplate the human-animal similarity 	POS

first of all i don t understand why some people find this movie so anti-american sure there are moments when the u s are accused directly like at the segments of youssef chahine ken loach and to a certain extent mira nair but come on they aren t naive accusations; instead they are based on real and documented facts and all the documents that the cia released about chile confirms this for example but returning to the film itself what i enjoyed most on it is the variety of moods we find in it we find children being educated for the respect of the all the people who died in the event; we find a unhappy couple that will be changed by the tragedy of that day; we find common people that have their feelings downgraded on the shadow of the events of september and react differently to this with dignity or frustration; we even find someone in the movie for who the fall of the towers grounds for a moment of real happiness all these visions and others - as powerful as these or even more - make a consistent blend and help the spectator to have a glimpse about how different people spread across the world reacted to the events of september th thus what we see is a panorama that is much more complex than whites and blacks and this may make some people infuriated; but this is the world where we live and in it there is no place for manicheistic ideologies regardless of what presidents or priests may say us finally i think it s a shame that there isn t even a release date for this movie in the united states of america it s a shame because most of the american people is asking why this catastrophe happened and this movie could give some clues to them this film puts very clearly - differently of what some people of this forum think - that everything we do today will determine our future and that the errors of the past will affect how we live today 	POS
it is no wonder this movie won prices it is a movie that lingers to any soul it isn t a wonder why it took paul reiser years to finally give in and talk to peter falk about his idea i can understand every part of it this is a movie that will make you cry just a tear or thousands story: when sam kleinman gets a letter from his wife about her leaving him to find something else his son and him take out on a road trip to find her and while they do that they find something lost friendship family and affection for each other at the beginning you know whats going to happen but none soever the story is not that easy to figure out from beginning to end it is a ride between a father and his son and a husband and his wife it is no wonder it took paul reiser years to write this beautiful romance comedy actors: well you cant say anything else that what i about to say hey it is with peter falk in it he is a legend everything he does in movies are magic when you use peter falk in a romance comedy what do you think you get a perfect outcome it is no wonder this movie is that perfect and won that many prices as the son paul reiser does an excellent job although he isn t a great actor always that doesn t mean that this didn t work actually peter falk and paul reiser plays the perfect father and son the rest of the cast is good enough but you don t see them as much so just say they do what they shall to get this to shine even more music: it doesn t always work when using music sometimes it just doesn t fit but that is not the thing in this movie the music is perfect in tune it makes the movie even more compelling this part of the movie will shine off as good as the other parts a great soundtrack for a romance comedy thats for sure overall: there are so many romance comedy movies out on tapes dvds blu-ray and what not but this movie is one of the special ones it doesn t happen everyday that you can create a story like this it takes years thinking about this and the fact is that actually what it took to make it a great piece that should be bought and kept into the human soul see it when you get old and see it with your father at a old age i think then this movie will spark like no other ever made 	POS

this film is very interesting i have seen it twice and it seems glover hit the nail on the head with what he claims to he wants to accomplish i for one can relate to the outrage that the filmmaker clearly expresses against the current thoughtless corporate drivel that is an onslaught in our every media center and the things that we as a culture are supposed to not think about due to corporate media control the outrage that glover expresses through the outrageous elements in the films is both clear in its visceral aggressiveness and beautiful in its poetic potency i am glad i saw this film and it is even clearer that glover is up to something interesting with part two of what will be a trilogy it is fine everything is fine see that also people that dismiss this film as thoughtless or pretentious are really missing the boat this is an intelligent films if you can see it with his live show he performs before with his books that is also very wroth while the way you get in to his mindset is really something you will have an experience 	POS

i was so surprised by how great the man in the moon truly was i mean at first i was kinda expecting a cheesy and predictable film but i decided to put that aside when watching well when it was over i was just left stunned mainly in tears by how great the man in the moon turned out to be this movie is so entertaining and is so aware of its tone and its just a fabulous film the acting was great especially from reece witherspoon who was so cute and lovable and everyone else there wasn t anything that really bothered me i felt the ending kinda predictable but very well done at that also i felt some things to be plain or as if it had been done before but still a great film overall i must say i don t to much to say about this film not that it was bad its just a film you either like or don t like i would however recommend this to any and everyone even if you don t like these type of films its still an enjoyable film out of stars	POS
basically the exact same movie as house of wax - vincent price s first genuine horror hit released the previous year - but seriously who cares because the mad magician offers just as many sheer thrills delightful period set-pieces joyous -d effects sublime acting performances and macabre horror gimmicks as its predecessor never change a winning team is exactly what writer crane wilbur must have thought when he penned down price s character don gallico another tormented soul besieged by fate and out for vengeance against those who wronged him don gallico is about to perform his very first own illusionist show as gallico the great and plans to exhibit the greatest magic trick in history; entitled the girl and the buzz saw gallico s promising solo career is abruptly ruined before it even begins when his previous employer ross ormond appears on stage and shoves a contract under his nose stating that all of gallico s inventions are the rightful property of the company the sleazy and relentless ormond who by the way also ransacked gallico s once beloved wife takes off with the buzz saw trick and programs it in the show of gallico s rival the great rinaldi inevitably gallico snaps and sadistically butchers ormond but  also being a master of creating disguises  recreates his victim s image and even starts leading a double life the mad magician is an amusing and thoroughly unpretentious s horror movie in grand guignol style with a whole lot of improbably plot twists the landlady turns out a brilliant crime novelist and a handful of fantastically grotesque gross-out moments although they obviously remain suggestive for most part the -d delights near the beginning of the film like a yo-yo player and a goofy trick with water fountains merely just serve as time-filler and contemporary s hype but it s still fun to watch even now and without the means to properly behold them the mad magician is also interesting from a periodical setting point of view as the events take place around the time fingerprints were starting to get used as evidence material and the character of alice prentiss is an obvious reference towards famous crime authors of that era needless to state that vincent price remains the absolute most essential element of triumph in this film as well as from nearly every other horror movie this legendary man ever starred in like no other actor could ever accomplish price depicts the tormented protagonist who gradually descends further and further into mental madness in such an indescribably mesmerizing way you pity don gallico yet at the same time you fear him enormously you support his vile acts of retaliation and yet simultaneously you realize his murderous rampage must end in death vincent price simply was a genius actor and in my humble opinion the embodiment of the horror genre 	POS
this is a really funny and sexy movie - that is not just silly but has great acting it s the kind of movie where the characters are so entertaining that you feel like you are connected to everyone in the theater i saw it at the boston film festival and i found myself frequently laughing out loud with everyone else and also moved by some of the movie s more serious parts it s a unique movie about two doctors and i don t want to give anything away but there are some powerful scenes as well really funny ones - plus the dialogue is great wood harris character has a unique relationship with his girlfriend zoe saldana and brian white and mya are also funny and sexy in their roles if you get a chance to see it - go - you won t be disappointed it s worth seeing again wood harris deserves an award 	POS
no this isn t a sequel to the fabulous ova series but rather a remake of the events that occurred after the death of ghim and the disappearance of woodchuck it is also more accurate to the novels that inspired this wonderful series which is why characters namely orson and shiris are reintroduced and why the story may seem slightly different to those used to the ova the booklet included in the set provides excellent answers to such questions as do various online sites the first eight episodes of this -part tv series focus on the fateful battle at demon dragon mountain the remaining episodes introduce us to spark a blue-haired knight wannabe who identifies with parn and his ragtag team of misfits as they attempt to stop the dark wizard wagnard from resurrecting kardis the destroyer while it isn t quite the equivalent of the original lodoss war we all love the finale where parn saves deedlit from wagnard don t we this tv follow-up is still great fun for fantasy fans even if the animation is limited and a step down from the artistic streak of the first lodoss this -part series has its elements of appeal the fully-realized characters engaging storyline magic romance and a superb soundtrack scored by kaoru wada of ninja scroll all give this uneven spin-off some punch while the ova dub of lodoss has been criticized for one reason or another i generally liked it and still consider it one of my favorite dubs so i had significant hopes for the dub for chronicles made in - for the most part the lodoss tv english track is of passable if not stellar quality; it does however have its share of problems much of the original cast who lent their english voices to the characters of lodoss return including lisa ortiz as deedlit which is a nice bonus on the other hand billy regan s more mature sounding parn is a bit offputting he doesn t do a bad job but his voice came across as grating for the first eight episodes causing some anti-dub fans to instantly diss the dub but by the time spark and company take the stage i found it less bothersome i don t know if it s because he improved or if it just grew on me also not everyone from the oav dub returns jayce reeves only voices wagnard terrifically for one episode; he s replaced by pete zarustica for the whole show who gives a scratchy but still malevolent turn as well as the expected evil laughter anthony cruise s kashue on the other hand is too weary and takes about five or so episodes to find his stride oliver gregory is probably the most effective as orson especially during his final dramatic scenes aside from lisa ortiz deedlit karen smith shiris john knox ashram and al muscari slayn the dub s best voices come from some of the newer characters including crispin freeman spark maar garrack -episodes - - roxanne beck little neese meg frances who voices pirotess in the oav but also voices ryna with vulnerability and sassiness as well as karla and especially angora deb who steals every scene she s in as leaf the half-elf the rest of the cast isn t terrible by any means but a little more uneven than the oav dub some are all right aldonova greevus while others are lackluster hobb palace guards dragons etc and few were awful in particular prince reona s va is too harsh and monotone for a fighter of justice in fact the lack of aural continuity some cast members get new voices for some unexplained reason by the time we get to some of the later episodes is one of the problems of the dub others include less memorable and more awkward sounding dialogue uneven synchronization and finally i apologize in advance to the fans of this the lodoss island segments these offbeat super-deformed interludes at the end of each episode will either amuse or drive you batty admittingly i at first found them to be a major nuisance but they sorta grew on me after a while besides there are some showstoppingly hilarious lines such as i m king kashue and this is my cashew i m really quite a nut these flaws rank the dub for chronicles just a notch just below that for the ova resulting in an uneven english track summed up best as ok if one wonders if the japanese language track is the preferred listening choice well guess what the japanese version has its good and bad points too while some voices are less annoying than the english language track i found others to be less appealing than the english equivalents in particular the actress who does deedlit is nowhere nearly as good as lisa ortiz or yumi tohma plus i should mention that the japanese cast is not the same as the ova because the series was made seven years after the original all but one sho hayami of the cast members are replaced by new ones although they do a respectably good job it may be a major annoyance for those who were used to the japanese ova cast shows that not everything in japanese is better than english eh despite its flaws chronicles of the heroic knight is still a fine series which deserves to hold its own ground its not without its rough spots and doesn t always live up to its predecessor yet there s enough good points to counter the bad making this a moderately enjoyable fantasy anime 	POS

this cecil b demille epic of the old west contains what may be jean arthur s finest performance as a hysterical eccentric incurably amoral but devotedly doting calamity jane she really pulled it off gary cooper is at his most taciturn but manages some occasional pithy sayings: the plains are big but trails cross sometimes the story is a pastiche to end all pastiches all the cowboy heroes of western lore seem to be in there somehow except for jesse james even abraham lincoln opens the story in person or at least demille would have us believe so there is no room for anything so evanescent as subtlety this is a stomp em in the face tale for the masses a remarkable thing about this film however is that it is a very early full frontal attack on what eisenhower was eventually to name the military industrial complex it isn t just a story about gun-runners but about arming anyone for money and doing so from the heart of washington but let s not get into politics let s leave that to demille who can be guaranteed to be superficial the chief interest of this film all these years later is that it uses the first film score composed by george antheil who has a lot to say about the job in his autobiography bad boy of music antheil seems to have originated the big sound adopted by all subsequent westerns whereby the plains sing out with the voices and sounds of countless cowboys in the sky celebrating the open spaces and interweaving common melodies that is why it does not sound at all unusual because we have heard it a thousand times but he seems to have been the first to summon up the combined rustlings of all the sage brush into this symphony of the open skies which has entered into american mythic lore and given it a soundtrack which has never varied since then corny as it may be but doubtless appropriate it is amusing to see anthony quinn in an early appearance as a cheyenne indian gabby hayes is in there somewhere but you miss him in the crowd gary cooper overtops them all looming large - but when did he ever loom small 	POS
the characters were alive and interesting the plot was excellently paced the pyro effects were masterfully accomplished and it takes a basic love triangle story and tosses in a science-fiction element into it i could identify with many of the characters and their motivations made logical rational sense in the framework of the story the camera-work was great the audio clear and accurate the background music perfectly chosen for effect the singing firemen a nice talented memorable oddity the sets brilliantly crafted and the special effects performed with a skilled talent i am a tad puzzled how an entire mini-carnival in a chain-store s parking lot could be powered by one single lamppost outlet that seems impossible to say the least the fight between the brothers near the end of the movie was brilliant though having jim varney in a non-clown role was a wonderful touch too as played the semi-serious role of a carny very well 	POS
thre isn t a single scorsese movie i d place on a list of my favorite movies but this is the best thing i ve run through my dvd player in about five years scorsese s patient elucidation of favorite film moments and how hollywood works is incredibly gracious calm and intelligent it s dvd-sides worth of material it would have to be a british production since everything about american corporate culture would have trampled the quiet methodical no frills put-the-focus-on-the-content approach that is taken here and an american production would have demanded he say he liked only movies that were popular favorites i wish everyone took a page from his love of movies you should love the movies you do for personal idiosyncratic and specific reasons not just more me-too votes for the godfather etc people have no clue what ideas are being explored in their favorite movies if they did movies would be more interesting than they are scorsese does know what ideas are being explored and that makes him a compelling involved speaker on the topic i really appreciate his articulate generous interviews over the last decade on a negative note scorsese is best when he s excited to show you some obscure movie rather than when he s didactically teaching you something well-established about film history and i do wish he pluck those three hairs out of the bridge of his nose it s very distracting 	POS
this final entry in george lucas s star wars movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot however this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series on the contrary sure it s not as groundbreaking as its predecessors and a bit more slow-going at times but return of the jedi still offers a lot to warrant the price of admission the first third of the movie where luke and his friends rescue han from the palace of jabba the hutt is a classic jabba a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language not only makes a great villain but a memorable one too it must have been a nightmare to construct this giant puppet much less give it the spark and life that we see on the finished product actually what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of jabba s court including the intimidating slavering rancor and scary sarlaac pit monster it builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the while things get a little bit slower around the second act where luke discovers that he and leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of endor home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart ewoks most of the complaints about return of the jedi that i ve read seem to be centered on these furry creatures in that they somehow disrupt the tone of the saga i don t totally agree with that although this moment is probably played out a bit longer than it should however their leader wicket played by warrick davis is a delightfully memorable creation and watching how they handle the imperial troops technology with their simple natural weapons provides a nice contrast by the time we get to the third act though the pace picks up again as we intercut between the ewoks battle against the troops lando and the rebel forces launching an attack against the empire s all-new half-completed death star and luke s final showdown with darth vader and the emperor the latter ties with the jabba palace sequence as the highlight of the movie mark hamill flexes his acting chops once again as luke skywalker in these scenes and watching him as a fully matured jedi knight makes for an unforgettable performance also as iconic as james earl jones voice as darth vader is he is rivaled only by the shriveled crone-like emperor played with deliciously raspy frightening evil by ian mcdiarmid the tension between this trio heightens the excitement of this climactic moment which is appropriately darkly lit and menacingly underscored the star wars movies have always set standards for special effects and the technical work in return of the jedi can easily hold a candle to its predecessors the space battle fights are as exhilarating as always and the speeder bike chase through the forest is a knockout of course given that this movie was made after a new hope and the empire strikes back it probably shouldn t be so surprising that the special effects have reached an even greater level of excellence the acting is classic star wars fare; hamill harrison ford and carrie fisher all mature and deepen into their roles and anthony daniels provides more hilarious moments as c- po frank oz s yoda only appears in two scenes but he makes the most of it and yes there s also john williams music all told while return of the jedi falters a little bit in the middle the first and third acts deliver in style making this a rather satisfactory finale to one of the greatest sagas ever in george lucas re-released the classic star wars in digitally restored and revamped special editions which featured added-in effects and or shots as well as some enhancements of the three return of the jedi appears to have caused the most commotion with star wars fans perhaps it can be due to the jarringly out-of-place albeit funny if you re not so easily offended jedi rocks musical number in jabba s palace which although technically amazing does disrupt the flow of the film however i did like the ending montage scenes where we see victory celebrations occurring on the various planets of the galaxy this dvd version features yet more tweaking--we get to see more montage finale scenes notably on naboo where we hear what sounds like jar jar binks screaming wesa free and in what is probably the most controversial change hayden christensen as the specter of anakin skywalker in the closing scenes probably due to the intense and unfair disdain fans have for his somewhat shaky work in episode ii: attack of the clones it seems inevitable that fans would put this edition down for that alone however if you re watching the star wars saga chronologically and contemplating about it chances are you may react a little differently nonetheless it is an issue that fans have raised so it s probably best to be warned beforehand as nice as it would be to have lucas release the original versions of these three classic films he nonetheless stands by what he said about these revamps being the definitive editions of his classic trilogy and when viewing the star wars movies altogether as one complete saga as lucas intended it actually makes sense to keep them technically and aurally consistent the original films will always be engraved in our memories but these new incarnations are just as much fun if one can give them a chance 	POS

one of the best comedy series to ever come out of britain mark gatiss reece shearsmith and steve pemberton are terrific actors and performers who seem at home with drama as they are with comedy ably supported by their writing partner jeremy dyson they have peopled the series with the most memorable characters of recent years little britain pales into insignificance as a poor imitation of their ideas consistently original and groundbreaking i am sure that as many people hate these series as love them but i am equally as sure that no one could have no opinion on log i have yet to see the feature length movie but i have heard good things and bad things so i will reserve judgement the original radio series from which log came was as innovative as the tv series became i don t know whether the tv series made it to the us but i would be fascinated to see how american audiences found the weird englishness of the humour	POS
i noticed at once that this movie really wasn t based on dodie smith s novel in any case it was a nice idea that pongo and perdita s son now had his own puppies the cutest of the dalmatians was of course little snowball who was completely spotless till the very end of the film to be honest i didn t know what to think when cruella de vil seemed to have changed completely kind in fact i have often thought about the possibility that she could become friendly but now that she so quickly changed into herself again and announced that she was cruella once more i almost began to be really worried about chloe s dalmatians actually the scene in which the puppies watched lady and the tramp while chloe and kevin had their dinner was much better than i had expected i also was fond of the parrot who played to be a dog and it was incredible that the dogs had learned so many tricks for this movie of course i was content that at the end the dalmatians were saved again but i would have liked to know what was going to happen to cruella after she had lost her whole property and what on earth could the dogs home do with such a huge sum of money finally it was quite touching that snowball also had spots at the very end of the film 	POS

this is a very strange film by director animator richard williams all who know of william s work know it s a bit off-kilter if not ingenious but this one takes the cake it features two hapless ragdolls who have to save their owner s new french doll from a lustful pirate toy and find themselves at the mercy of several bizarre characters along the way the strength in this movie lies primarily in its aesthetic quality; its strange character designs its powerful animation and its stark contrast of the sweet and scary williams brilliant animation portrayed raggedy ann and andy as real rag dolls floppy and darned rather than simple cartoon versions of the dolls which made it more believable at least in a visual sense the animation shines on the bring us the camel-with-the-wrinkled-knees whose body walks with two different personalities controlling each end the silent-movie chase with sir leonard looney and of course the greedy the greedy animation on its own is possibly the most exquisite psychedelic animation i ve ever seen there s something about this animation that just makes your jaw drop--and every second it s something new living in what was deemed the taffy pit the greedy is a massive blob man that lives in and mercilessly eats sweets he sings a song that i can t help but feel hold some sexual undertones then tries to kill raggedy ann for her candy heart the only complaint i have about this film is that there are too many songs it continuously bogs down the movie s pace because there are sixteen of them there are about six good songs which should have been the only ones including i look and what do i see no girl s toy blue though they didn t need to make him sing it twice i never get enough because i love you and maybe i m home the others just seem unnecessary and frankly aren t too amazing to listen to this is a weird film with strange undertones but if that s what you re looking for you won t find better 	POS
in the film kongwon-do ui him it features a relatively intimate look into the meaningfulness as well as general meaninglessness into the lives of various koreans; empty people seeking ways to fill themselves enjoying the escapism of nature from the beginning to the end of the film we observe the fallibility of the various characters; we learn of their shortcomings and their desires the overall complexity captured within human life and yet the overal simplicity of humanity although the film is slow-moving it can be very contemplative it does not force any ideas but allows the ideas to come about themselves it allows the concepts to reveal themselves the film ends as well and as suddenly as it begins and one truly understands the meaning of aloneness that love is often an act of selfishness and the many mistakes that we make it is a look into everyday life very well and beautifully done if you are looking for action or for intense drama this is not the film for you however if you enjoy honest original and meaningful films that are not forced and without glitz this is a great film to watch 	POS
the great caruso displays the unique talents of mario lanza he shows great acting capacity and is in top form as a lyrical singer paired with dorothy kirsten soprano of the metropolitan opera indeed i dare to say that he performs some songs better than caruso check a vuchella from tosti and la danza from rossini the mgm art and music departments also did a good job this movie could be perfect were it not for the awkward presence of ann blyth; we see that she is trying her best dressed in the fifties style in scenes just before - unforgivable lanza deserved a better leading lady and blyth should stick to less demanding productions also notice that ms kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film with lanza giving the wrong notion that caruso had a kind of permanent leading soprano 	POS
all i hear about is how poorly the animation is done it may not be up to par with what everyone expects but look at it this way would you expect perfection in hell it is my belief that the animation was made dry and gritty on purpose it was great to see her character transformation in this movie considering it will probably be as close to live action as we will ever get i hope for a sequel very soon if we want live action i think we may be better off with chastity or purgatori i don t think lady death would transfer well to film but be that as it may it is my own personal belief that all the naysayers about this movie are dead wrong no pun intended 	POS

given the low budget and production limitations this movie is very good it is plausible realistic and shows how the csikos hungarian horsemen who lived on the plains puszta risked their lives to save a downed american pilot from the ruthless and savage nazis we are drawn into strong feelings for the young impressionable yet highly courageous boy--who admires the american pilot if you re looking for special effects superman heroes and magical endings--this movie is not for you if you want to feel what it must have been like to dodge the persistent amoral nazis and their lack of compassion then you will be enthralled by this movie i truly enjoyed it and for those who love horses dogs and humble helpful people who value freedom and those who aspire to that end this movie will be one you ll remember for a long time 	POS
this is a documentary that came out of the splendid work of a canadian landscape photographer whose interest has long been in the ravages left on earth by the excavations or buildings of man it begins with a vast factory complex crammed with people making a great variety of little things parts of high-tech equipment presumably; it isn t really made very clear the emphasis is on how big the place is and how many people are there and how they re herded around outside in little yellow jackets the film also shows the photographer working on a tall structure to do a still of the array of these people outside the factory and talking with his crew as he does so this is a world of relentless industrialization it s a relief at least to know these soulless images aren t going to be presented without a human voice as is the case in nikolaus geyrhalter s gleefully cold documentary about the food industry our daily bread manufactured landscapes contains images of people scavenging e-waste and a town many towns really being wiped out by the biggest dam ever with a single plangent trademark shot of a little girl in the rubble of her own neighborhood eating out of a bowl using a pair of chopsticks almost bigger than she is some of these scenes the ones with miserably underpaid workers slaving in dangerous and toxic places might have been shot memorably by the premier engagé photographer sebastião salgado but this photographer isn t as interested in seeing people up close his orientation places him somewhere in between salgado and the cold neutral modern landscape photographs of lewis baltz all this happens in china of course though there is earlier footage in black and white of the photographer working around a large shipbuilding site in bangladesh it is backed up by music in a new age industrial style that is alternately soothing and oppressive there are a good many stills of the photographer s work--or were some of them made by the film crew it isn t made clear edward burtynsky is the name of the photographer we see people wandering through exhibitions of his beautiful work-- big dramatic prints of carefully composed view camera color images with a handsome glow the irony is that burtynsky makes such unique and glorious pictures of places that are essentially blighted and to the ordinary eye are dispiriting and boring he admits himself that he takes no political stand when we are able to compare his images with those caught by the roaming eye of the film s cinematographer peter mettler burtynsky s work almost amounts to a kind of glorification and hence falsification but he is showing us places that if we look closely reveal their full dark story of ravage and neglect no matter how finely crafted the photographs of them may be logically but not entirely fortunately it is burtynsky whose voice-overs narrate most of the film as it ranges over various sites burtynsky s epiphanies may have inspired his decades of fine work but they amount to nothing but truisms about how we re changing the planet irreparably; are dependent on oil which will run out; that china has come into the game of massive industrialization late and so may burn out early with the depletion of fossil fuel the interest of manufactured landscapes would be much greater if there were perceptive new ideas to accompany it the reasons for watching it are two: to see glimpses of burtynsky s work and the raw materials the spaces he visits and chronicles so beautifully; and to observe scenes from the vast awesome daunting and rather horrifying industrialization of modern china because of the limitations of the narration the idea of the title manufactured landscapes feels insufficiently developed it even seems a misnomer new landscapes they are but they are the byproduct of manufacturing rather than manufactured landscapes of waste or wasted landscapes might be better titles there is much room left by this documentary for more intellectually searching work on film about this intriguing subject; and those who want to know more about edward burtynsky might do better to peruse his books or exhibitions 	POS
i have not seen each and every one of chan´s movies but this is for sure the best one i have seen so far the story in it self is nothing special really so i won´t go deeper into that what makes it special is the stunts the fighting the good acting the warm sense of humor the movie has a raging tempo all the way through and you are just stunned seeing it all the cool stunts of course made by jackie himself makes you want jump around in the couch and scream it´s just awesome even my mom was impressed by this cool movie when she saw it i know this police story can be a bit hard to get a hold of at least it is here in sweden but i can assure you it´s worth a try 	POS
a journey of discovery this film follows the lives of one family living in a sleepy island town in british columbia languorous and dreamy the inhabitants are satisfied to allow life to go on around them until a young fresh-faced teacher with new ideas arrives and brings with her life from the mainland slowly their indolent state is awakened the father and principal of the local school looks for excitement the mother for stability the oldest daughter for love and the youngest for power while not an incredible or ground-breaking piece of cinema the movie is quietly enjoyable and good for a tired night when the wind is blowing unfortunately i doubt anyone outside of canada will find it easily accessible 	POS

i don t think most people give this movie as much credit as it deserves i love low budget horror movies and this takes the cake especially for originality yes the scarecrow is a kung-fu fighting frightner but why not no one else is willing to go that far i really haven t had this much fun watching a movie since candyman so the town picks on this one kid calling him scarecrow even his mom doesn t care about him then he gets killed and the spirit is infused with in the scarecrow who then goes on a killing spree his demise is relatively easy to assume once the movie gets going the dedications at the end go straight to a bunch of horror directors but with most dedication towards dario argento really struck me as cool these folks who wanna make movies of a newer genre over the movie has a lot of arnold rip offs with one liners you ll definitely laugh at like stick around and he kills the sheriff with a stick i would say grab a pizza some friends an laugh your a$$ off with this movie i love it for its originality most fun 	POS

 st watched - out of dir-sidney franklin : well told account of farmers in china and their rise to prominence and struggles with what mother nature throws at them this movie is based on an award winning novel and chronicles a family starting with the son s arranged marriage to a slave girl the movie does a good job of keeping your interest despite a somewhat hammy performance by the lead played by paul muni it chronicles wong long the character played by muni and how he works the land buys more land eventually becomes very rich but then returns to the land where he originally started the relationship between him and his wife played by luise rainer is the main thread of the story besides the land itself and despite the obvious non-chinese actors it does a pretty good job of displaying the country and it s people it s obvious that mgm used it s money to create a really good epic with this one in an era where they could probably afford it the scene with the locusts is done exceedingly well and the rest of th movie really looks good warranting the best cinematography award at the oscars in that year the definitive definition of an epic is what this story is and it s pulled off pretty well 	POS
titanic is a classic i was really surprised that this movie didn t have a solid ten overall in the imdb user rankings maybe it s just cool to not give titanic credit nowadays but when it was first made it was really something when the movie came out people flocked to the theaters when it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month it was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot like the frozen baby or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd many people died on that ship and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that james cameron stepped up to and let s not forget the amazing romance between jack and rose whether or not their relationship was a figment of someone s imagination it was lovely they barely knew each other but they would die for each other they trusted each other they sure as hell are giving romeo and juliet a run for their money i ll never let go jack titanic is a great film down to it s very core it is a powerful story told through brilliant acting excellent cinematography beautiful music and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers it really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie 	POS

i have to admit that purple rain is one of my deepest guilty pleasures purple rain not only broke boundaries it set a decade the costumes the music the behavior and the dancing to this day my friends and i still jam to the purple rain soundtrack and pretend to be prince and the revolution now the movie itself i just meant what i said in the title because for the most part this movie itself is made by the music the acting please don t let me judge on that since this is one of my favorite guilty pleasures because i know that it was not oscar worthy by any means but i think the duo that took this movie was morris and jarome their speech about passwords was just beyond hilarious i just want to rate this movie on the concert sequences because i felt that it was what made the movie prince is a musical genius and created beautiful music while the movie and acting is pretty bad this movie is still a fun one to watch at night and even dance too this movie defined the s so just have fun with it prince would want it that way just to party on down oh boy that sounded lame 	POS
this is a nice little movie with a nice story that plays the most important role in the entire movie it s a quite intriguing dramatic story with also romance present in it the story is being told slowly but this works out all too well for its build up the characters are nice and portrayed nicely by its actors normally i m not a too big fan of the asian acting style but the acting in this movie was simply good of course the movie is quite different in its approach and style from other genre movies produced in the west in a way this movie is more advanced already with its approach than the western movies made during the same era i only wished the movie its visual style would had been a bit better for a movie that is considered a kind of an art-house movie this movie is certainly lacking in some well looking sequences this was obviously a quite cheap movie to make and it got made quite generically not that this is a bad thing it just prevent this movie from truly distinct itself and raising itself above the genre but oh well this movie is all about its well constructed story and characters that are in it in that regard this movie most certainly does not disappoint 	POS
one of the all-time great science fiction works as visionary and thought-provoking as blade runner or even gilliam s own brazil willis gives his best performance here but he s outdone by pitt s incredibly frenetic turn that s unlike anything he s done before or since even stowe isn t out of her league here though the story is very layered and offers quite a lot to think about the climactic scene is beautifully magnificent and the last lines fit perfectly the scenes in the mental hospital are creepy and yet so funny in their own way lots of dark humour on display here fantastic production design and suitably bizarre cinematography in my top ten 	POS

a masterful treatment of james caine s the postman always rings twice as luchino visconti s first film shot primarily around ferrara in a soulless war-torn italy the original negative was thought destroyed but visconti saved a print and fortunately we can see this early neo-realist work today a ruggedly handsome massimo girotti and clara calamai who had recently revealed her breasts in la cena delle beffe star as the sensually-charged and ill-fated lovers who plot to kill her husband unusual ending in which although crime does not pay one pays in a way not directly linked to the crime excellent direction script acting and cinematography reportedly not as good as the french le dernier tournant but probably better than the us version featuring lana turner and john garfield in the lead roles highly recommended 	POS
british comedies tend to fall into one of two main types: the quiet introspective usually romantic study and the farcical social satire settings characters and concepts vary but certain characteristics place the vast majority of shows into one of the two categories butterflies is perhaps the epitomé of the first type the scripts are very verbal including long interior monologues by the main character ria a basically happy but unsettled housewife curious about what she might have missed out on when she embarked on a thoroughly conventional life when she meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman who makes his interest in her quite clear she toys with the idea of finding out what the other path might have offered the acting and scripts are always on the money which makes one s reaction to the show almost entirely a personal one: i was neither blown away by it nor turned off my mother on the other hand adored this show i think the degree to which one identifies with ria s dilemma is the most important factor in determining one s reaction to butterflies 	POS
i really liked batman: dead end i thought that it had a theatrical feel to it and that given a chance collora could make a fine film this trailer didn t quite give me the same impression the story line or potential story line was quite good but due to the acting and special effects left me feeling like this would have made a good tv movie or television show first michael o hearn is not that good a superman i actually thought he in his brief appearance made a decent clark kent sorry i just don t think of superman as being that buff the suit kent wore masked his size batman may have the body of a bodybuilder but not superman supes is toned no doubt but not bulk anyway i didn t care for all his posing and his transformation from kent to superman seemed cheezy now this may not be just o hearn s fault collora may have to take some of the credit for poor scripting and direction second the special effects for flying were cheezy superman flies through the sky if was obvious that this superman flew close to the ground with the telephone cables and buildings visible above him i don t think there were any full body shots of superman flying evidently the harness and rigging supporting o hearn must have been located on his lower torso all in all it was a good trailer i d probably pay to see a film if ever made and would be sure to catch it on television the story line an alliance between lexcorp and wayne industries superman jealous of lois s attraction to wayne lex and twoface teaming to beat superman and the joining of forces between batman & superman is a good one i m sure with a larger budget and approval for a full film collora and company even o hearn could deliver a decent film certainly one better than the most of the comic based crap coming out of hollywood lately 	POS

after not having much luck at selling his screenplays to the new movie industry during the first decade of the th century in playwright d w griffith got the job that would make him a legend: he was hired by the biograph company as a director of movies it wasn t really what griffith had expected when he decided to enter the movie business but he accepted the job and in less than a year he became biograph s most successful director thanks to his original approach to film-making and the wild inventive of his narrative many years later he would direct the birth of a nation in the movie that would revolutionize film-making and make him one of cinema s first recognized authors; however a lot of what would make him a great filmmaker can be found in the many short films he made for biograph company in the early years of his career s the sealed room is one of those and also one of the few horror movies of that very first decade of the th century the sealed room is a story set in the th century in which a count arhtur v johnson has built a windowless room in his castle it is a small yet nice and very cozy room as it is meant to be used to enjoy the love and company of his wife the countess marion leonard in a more private way however the count doesn t know that his wife is not exactly faithful as she is infatuated with the minstrel henry b walthall at court with whom she is having an affair as soon as the count gets busy with his own business the countess calls the minstrel and both lovers go to enjoy the count s new room when the count returns he discovers she is missing and begins to suspect finally discovering the two lovers in his room; but instead of making a scene he prefers to remain hidden as he decides that there is a better punishment for his unfaithful wife: to seal the windowless room with the couple inside written by griffiths regular collaborator frank e woods the sealed room takes elements from edgar allan poe s the cask of amontillado and mainly honoré de balzac s la grande breteche to create a haunting gothic melodrama based on the themes of treachery and sadism despite having a runtime of minutes woods screenplay develops the story in a very good way and plays remarkably well with the horror elements of the story while a melodrama at heart woods focus on the character of the count and his sadism creates one of the best horror characters of these early era the sealed room is definitely a very simple and basic story but woods handling of the dark and morbid thematic of its plot makes the story a very entertaining film that was very different than most griffith s melodramas in the sealed room griffith uses his talents to experiment with tension and suspense in a different way than his usual while he often played with editing to create thrillers that excited his audience in this movie his focus was to create desperation and horror playing with the inherent feeling of claustrophobia that the source stories had it is interesting how the story starts as another of his melodramas and slowly the pacing becomes faster as the horror themes begin to dominate the plot culminating in his great use of editing for the final scenes not being a movie where camera tricks are essential what shines the most in the sealed room is griffith s talent to direct his actors as the legendary filmmaker manages to bring the best out of his cast with his usual natural style far removed from the staginess that was the norm in his day as usual the cast was comprised of usual collaborators of griffith starting with arthur v johnson as the count johnson gives a great performance and truly conveys the character s transition from loving husband to sadistic monster his performance is not without a touch of overacting but actually that adds realism to the character s exaggerated personality as the countess marion leonard looks very good and is also very effective in her acting conveying a natural charm that makes hard not to sympathize with her in her treachery finally the legendary henry b walthall appears as the handsome minstrel and while far from being one of his best performances he manages to give a proficient acting that also adds a nice touch of comedy to the film while not of real importance to the plot it s nice to see other members of griffith s stock company in the background like his wife linda arvidson and a young mary pickford as nobles at court while not exactly a masterpiece the sealed room is a notable exercise of editing to create suspense and tension like griffith used to do in those days the movie has very good set design and while of a very low budget griffith s care for details makes it look very convincing and works perfectly along with his directing style the change of focus to horror makes it to stand out among other of his films from that era and johnson s performance as the sadistic count makes it worth a watch while griffith will always be remembered for his highly influential and controversial the birth of a nation the early short films he made before it really give a good idea of the development of the techniques and the style that would make him a legend simple yet elegant the sealed room is a fun movie to watch and one of the few horrors of the first decade of the th century 	POS
eight simple rules started as a very entertaining series i love john ritter and his character paul hennessey and the relationship he had with his children was the best part of the show i have always preferred kerry to bridget bridget has been done before kerry is quite unique and i can relate to her in many ways although i m not sure i like the direction her character went in later series early episodes were fun good simple teenage plots about paul and cate disciplining the kids however i think the show lost it s sparkle when john ritter died i admired the cast and crew for wishing to continue the series but when he died i felt the programme did to to me the whole point of the show was based around the guide of the simple rules of dating my teenage daughter it was written by a real man with teenage daughters and the relevance and the angle of the show had changed without the hennessey dad bridget seemed to get more annoying rory stayed the same and cate was always giving her offspring life s lessons which before seemed funnier when it was all left to paul i think the granddad is funny especially when he s watching great escape but feel c j is unnecessary to the show he is funny in parts but i felt the story lines at the time of his arrival were very similar to other american comedy series over all the newer ones aren t bad just missing excitement and does anyone else find it irritating that cate works at the school and c j and granddad s always there too i would always recommend this show to friends as it was very strong at the beginning and well worth watching for paul and kerry but later ones were about average at best 	POS

this movie is difficult to watch in our fast-paced culture of the st century but it is worth it for the messages that it conveys chiefly the consequences and ramifications of technology upon society specifically when that technology is used for warfare this movie presents a full circle cycle of dehumanization and rehumanization as influenced by the advent of technology and the subsequent deconstruction of civilization and therefore serves as a cautionary tale against the misuse of technology but as the circle completes itself familiar themes and sentiments pop up again to present self-serving rather than self-destructive ways that humanity may utilize technology brilliant for it s time the picture and sound quality may pose a challenge for some but as a landmark in the history development and evolution of the sci-fi genre it is a must in the end free will and free choice are once again posed to humanity as a means for controlling our own destiny rather than having it served to us by someone else or indeed the state ofsociety itself as shaped by world events those who are downtrodden by what life throws their way sometimes tend to remain so but yet there is always a glimmer of hope and continuity that remains as this film posits as far as qualifying as sci-fi one of the biggest common demoninators of that genre is it s speculative nature it asks us the questions what if these events happened this way and what effect would it have on society or the individuals within it how would we react as far as influence this film projects those speculative sciences that make sci-fi as unique as it is and keeps us asking those important questions 	POS
as for many on here i can t help but praise the cast and crew who developed talespin and others they made throughout my childhood i as all who have commented here have thoroughly enjoyed the quality of not just the animation but the quality of the story lines and the characters to class this work of art as a cartoon could never do talespin justice in fact it s an insult to class it as a cartoon talespin is an animation and nothing less it is evidently the greatest work of genius to be produced at disney to date when disney pulled it from the air little did they realise what they did and i m sure their souls have been tortured by regret ever since i ll take a moment to explain from the first which is ducktales to the last which i think is darkwing duck disney has been plagued with failures due to political correctness and have taken a quantum leap backwards since they prefer quantity over quality now not to mention the room full of monkey s for the story s i couldn t have my children watching the mind-numbing cartoons they throw out now in fear that they would all turn out to be homer simpson some time in the future and % of the blame would be on me for permitting them to watch it i couldn t let that happen which is why i have all of the shows from the late s to the mid s on a harddrive so one day my children couldn t be corrupted by the cartoon crap of today and to savour the last piece of childhood i have and to hold on to and i owe that all to talespin talespin to me is without a doubt the best animation ever produced in the world on account of it s depth charm wit compassion emotion and lack of truly bad quality and story lines of which many have today do you see any of that content in say ed edd and eddie or anything else you can think of the rubbish produced today can be likened to some year old s undecipherable hyroglyph depicting a picasso the next time you watch an episode of talespin; take a look at the woodgrain on any wooden object or building such as higher for hire and salivate over the quality of workmanship and effort put into this animation even the one shot backgrounds were done as though they would use them again and again the buildings look true to the art deco movement which was popular in the time period depicted even the vehicles are true to life ok not all of the episodes were fantastic in animation but the lower grade scenes were covered up by the superior scenes so all in all it evened it all out by the end of the episode and you d probably never even notice at all unless you were focused and have an attention to detail the one thing i love about this is what i like to call the deliberate mistakes or intended mistakes in each episode and some have two for example in sheepskin deep where rebecca say s you re up to something baloo and baloo replies who me i m as innocent as a schoolboy take a look into rebecca s eyes i won t spoil the rest of the baloopers but just keep an eye out next time everyone elses comment s are bang on and % correct i have nothing else to add that others haven t said already on here disney wake up and smell the coffee you have been asleep for over a decade stop producing rubbish and bring back quality into animations and stop producing cartoons we have seen the proof of what you can do and we want it back as rapidly as possible 	POS

hard to categorize the film - perhaps it s an avant garde spy thriller mother night is a very good vonnegut novel and most certainly one of his easiest novels to adapt into a feature length film the film adaptation is very faithful to the original book the indie approach to how this film was produced is probably more effective than having a big hollywood studio financing it these days i doubt an intelligent novel like mother night would ever get the green light from the big hollywood grindhouses and normally that is too bad but not in this case mother night has tight direction and a solid cast nick nolte who seems to be getting better roles as he gets older still has that everyman persona that allows him to take on a wide range of different characters sheryl lee is beautiful and great as always i always thought she deserved better than she got out of the entertainment industry i guess making your debut as a dead girl twin peaks with little air time isn t the choicest of roles even if the tv show becomes a minor phenomenon anyway this film is totally enjoyable and you don t have to read the book to understand the movie in fact given today s geopolitical realities the novel s premise may appear dated and some younger viewers with little knowledge of history will be utterly confused by the events unfolding i am talking to you fellow americans who are students and scoring the lowest in the industrialized world in geography history and lord knows what other subjects 	POS
a very good adaptation of the novel by amrita pritam urmila and manoj bajpai have given their best there is a natural flair in the movie and i felt it right through it looked like bollywood finally gave away it s glamor and had some quality artists performing on screen content wise the movie depicted very much what exactly happened during partition by showing the sufferings of a particular family and also shows that trust in one s life goes beyond religion the best part was they did not make it a drama with a lot of tear shedding and melodrama i simply loved it 	POS
gere and danes star as workers for the department of public safety who keep track of released sex offenders gere who plays babbage refers to them as his flock gere is an over obsessed vigilante whom is on his way out he is training new comer allison to take over his job gere sees his flock as very sick disturbed puppies he asks them questions that are not on the list and tries to act like the police and solve crimes he keeps getting warned for this behavior hence the reason he is being replaced during his final few days on the job a young girl goes missing and babbage is sure it is one of his flock whom has gone astray him and allison narrow a list down and discover some of the offenders have gone awol so he decides that he needs to track the missing girl down rather than help the police that part is a little far fetched there is some sick twisted stuff shown in this film like when babbage and allison go to this building where a bunch of sick people do disturbing things to each other also there are the people who kidnapped the girl at the end of the film we see what sick freaks they are however i wouldn t call this movie excessive because not really much is shown on film final verdict: if you like thrillers and films about serial killers and cops chasing killers then you will like this 	POS
sure star wars a movie i have seen at least fifty times beats all the others in special effects but this film has every thing else it has horror non-graphical romance robots witty repartee intelligence surprisingly good special effects and drama i saw this film a couple of years ago in a revival with a newly struck print and i was amazed at how well it held up today i thought the old s style electronics would look hokey but they somehow looked futuristic and moderne ann francis in here mostly short skirts and bare feet with a girlish innocence that is hard to beat still gets a rise out of me the krell monster appearing in the ray beams still scares the bejebees out of me of course we all know that the great bird of the galaxy probably modeled much of star trek from this movie no one has yet to beat robby the robot in terms of personality sorry r d and c po this movie overall is the standard that all other science fiction films will have to measure up to honorable mention for the haunting electronic score which kept us all on pins and needles 	POS

actually i never bought into the metal was satanic and stuff but this movie kind of played on that idea though certainly not a movie to take seriously or to rate really high it does serve its purpose in that it entertains while it is playing the story has a metal band burned to death in their hotel one of their fans has a dream to this effect and said band starts to go on a kill spree from beyond the grave so yes a bit of nightmare on elm street plot going on here granted freddy never molested a girl in a car before there was another movie featuring a heavy metal band in it but it was very different in how it played out as it had a band that kind of took over a town of kids and made them crazy this one simply has the one fan of the band kind of helping the killer spirit at first then trying to stop him nothing to gruesome in it as i do not remember all that many gory kills quite frankly the scene i do remember most is the scene of the girl wearing the headphones and then being molested by some creature incarnation of the band nothing great but a nice time filler 	POS

bizarre trippy forget-about-a-story-and-full-steam-ahead low budget sci-fi about the williams family living in the california desert they become witness to a series of events that escalate in their level of strangeness; apparently they ve been caught in a time-space warp where past present and future collide this is the excuse for a parade of highly amusing special effects - a constant light and sound show dinosaur-like creatures that have at each other a friendly and tiny little e t who enchants the granddaughter and so on this picture does show off a little imagination if nothing else very nice music by richard band engaging special effects work from the likes of david allen randall william cook and peter kuran and importantly a likable family are key assets it generates a sense of child-like amazement; it may very well be that it s more of a romp for kids or the kids inside many of us who are able to gloss over any flaws in the narrative or presentation i found it hard to resist; it s a short and sweet minutes diversion and a decent credit for director john bud cardos of kingdom of the spiders fame and executive producer charles band 	POS

john cassavetes opening night is fantastic and fascinating; fantastic because it plays with the deepest fears we have inside our imagination fascinating because it never ceases surprising us with its very long duration of two hours and twenty minutes anyone who appreciates characters won t be able to take their eyes off the screen the story of an unstable actress myrtle gordon gena rowlands trying to put herself together for a play fighting her demons; opening night is not only about a woman on the verge of a breakdown but also about the complexities of the lives of theater actors and the theatrical world all of cassavetes characters here are experienced people that know about the world of theater; so half of the film takes place on a stage either where the performers do their job or at backstage where producers and writers and directors do their job cassavetes is so harsh with his characters that this unkindness turns towards the audience but the audience in the cinema because there is another audience in the theater of the film that doesn t know what is really happening and laugh because they think everything is performance and that s essentially what it is; it s just that the audience in the theater doesn t get to see backstage the way we do they don t experience gena rowlands exuberance before she goes out to that stage but most importantly; they don t know the reasons why she acts the way she does i always thought that it would be difficult to be friends with an actor myrtle rowland says she s an actress and that s the only thing she knows how to do; and i imagine that if i had a friend who was a professional performer it would be really difficult to tell when he s saying the truth because i would know he s an actor and he can fake anything at any time a lot of the things that myrtle does during the awful experiences the film puts her throughwe suspect if she s being real; the rest of the characters suspect too there is the writer sarah joan blondell who can t understand why myrtle doesn t understand the character she s written for her there s the director manny ben gazzara who can t accept the fact that his best actress might be losing it; the producer david paul stewart who doesn t know where to stand and myrtle s co-star maurice cassavetes himself who can t deal with the love they have for each other when she witnesses the death of a teenager a fan; all of this comes together and affects myrtle but no one knows if her delusions are for real they don t say anything because they don t want to upset her but the movie enters in a state of subconsciousness that only myrtle accepts at times we can tell that everyone has had it during these moments cassavetes brilliant script depicts a scary brutal honesty in the words the characters say in a discussion backstage; and not only what everyone tells myrtle but also what she says to them here are people who are not afraid to speak their mind and constantly change what they are thinking just like cassavetes way of making cinema and in this aspect the performances are more important here than in shadows because the characters are involved in a bigger picture; a bigger story that steps out of the trivial but in another aspect the actual way of making cinema this movie is no different from shadows there s a beautiful thing in the way al ruban s camera shoots the characters when someone s talking the camera doesn t focus on him it shoots the person who is listening; so we can see how he or she reacts to the things the other one s saying sometimes they don t care sometimes they are happy sometimes devastated improvisation might still be there though among all these wonderful performances near the end there s an unexpected scene where cassavetes and rowlands start talking non-stop whether this was improvised or not is not something we have to wonder we have just got to watch; and watching both of them exchanging life experiences and seeing words come truly alive in a conversation that means a lot more than what it showsit doesn t get more natural than that 	POS
my rating refers to the first seasons of stargate sg- which are wonderfully fresh creative and addicting when the cast stepped through the gate you never knew what lay on the other side starting around season the show took a different focus - still good but different the series follows the adventures of a team of humans and one alien who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the stargate the backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie stargate in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in egypt the episodes are light innocent and easy to watch and very creative many of the inventive stories could easily have been made into great sci-fi movies of their own what happens next was always unpredictable the characters on which the show rests are also well-defined and brilliantly performed their tone is serious but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humor they are simply fun to watch starting somewhere around season the series started to evolve into a continuing storyline based on fighting a single foe the goa uld then the ori the plots become more complex a lot more political strategic oriented and interdependent the characters were still as great as ever but the show was different in nature one thing that must be mentioned is to watch the episodes that commemorated the th and th episodes they are simply can t-miss shows they exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through seasons if you are a sci-fi fan watch a few episodes of the first seasons and you ll likely be hooked if you like evolving story lines between two opposing sides you have seasons of shows to look forward to 	POS
this animation has a very simple and straightforward good vs evil plot and is all about action what sets it apart from other animation is how well the human movements are animated it was really beautiful seeing the fleeing woman running around on the screen from left to right and look around her movements were done so well why don t they use this rotoscopic technique more these days it s quite effective fire and ice in it s prehistoric setting and scarcely dressed women was clearly devoted to showing the beautiful damsel in distress in various sexy ways her voluptuous body serving as pure eyecandy some may hate this and regard it as yet another moronic male sexual fantasy others including plenty of women will adore it s esthetic quality i for sure did not mind bakshi just loves animating lushious voluptuous babes as can also be seen in cool world and i don t think he has to apoligize since it s pretty much animation for adults but i had also enjoyed this animation as a child and i never forgot it this one was just special so different from the standard disney or anime fare and for that reason alone well worth the watch since it s possibly bakshi s finest for those who like animations with lushious women: try space adventure cobra as well i give fire and ice out of 	POS

before watching this movie i thought this movie will be great as flashpoint because before watching this movie flashpoint was the last jenna jameson and brad armstrong movie i previously watched as far as sexual scenes are concerned i was disappointed i thought sexual scenes of dreamquest will be great as flashpoint sexual scenes but i was disappointed except asia carrera s sexual scene any sexual scene in this movie doesn t make me feel great you know what i mean the great jenna jameson doesn t do those kind of sexual scenes of what she is capable of felecia and stephanie swift both of those lovely girls disappoint me as well as far as sexual scenes are concerned although its a adult movie but if you aside that sexual scenes factor this movie is very good if typical adult movie standards are concerned this movie definitely raised the standards of adult movies story acting direction sets makeups and other technical stuff of this movie are really great the actors of this movie done really good acting they all done a great job dreamquest is definitely raised the bar of quality of adult movies 	POS
i was absolutely blown away by john cassavetes s opening night it s the first movie of his that i ve seen that seems to be on a bigger scale thus it feels more mainstream but it still doesn t feel as if he grounded himself any more than he has in his previous films that is perhaps what makes it so intense there is also something undoubtedly cathartic about watching this movie it s about what in fact cassavetes has made a staple of his career an ideal that he has expressed behind the camera throughout his career as a director and is here expressing it in front rowlands s character middle-aged stage actress myrtle gordon cannot bring herself to play her role in the upcoming production as written so she uncalculatedly follows impulse after impulse resulting in what appears to be chaos on stage until she finds the right one it s a daringly abstract premise this is a movie that does not fail to capture the innate steering that one goes through during an emotional cleansing no one understands why myrtle does many of the things she does and it is seen and even portrayed as something destructive yet it just might be the best thing for her it may be a cleansing rather than a breakdown a withdrawal a cocoon a rebellion it all culminates into a meltdown cassavetes gives her character a brutally real touch which is that early on she is ardently arguing that she has nothing in common with her character yet she is in quiet but emotionally corroding fear that the opposite is true the last scene the climactic performance that myrtle shares with a character painfully estranged from her who is acting with her is one of the most interesting hilarious hard-hitting enlightening and enjoyable moments i ve ever seen in a movie 	POS
one of my favorite films for a number of years was last action hero ; unfortunately arnold schwarznegger decided to spoil my fun by becoming a corrupt scumbag politician; so now i can t bear any film he may had a hand in the adventures of jake speed actually toys with some themes similar to those in last hero; so i was pleased to find it on dvd so i could watch these themes played out so well despite the plot-within-the-plot involving white slavery during an african nation s civil war this is not an action movie the plot that the plot-within-a-plot is within is actually about a question that the film has no intention to resolve: is jake speed a real person that is helping the heroine save her sister from the white-slave trader; or is he actually a fictional character which means that the heroine has somehow entered the universe that really only exists in a series of pulp novels i suggest that this is not all that clearly defined in the film and that wayne crawford and andrew lane are perfectly aware of this the film thus becomes a presentation of what audiences may want from such a fictional adventure-story universe that s actually a rich theme the potential heaviness of which is lightened by the film s amiable and campy sense of humor there are weaknesses to the film - primarily it s cinematography which makes the film look like a tv show and the pacing does sag on occasion but i really like these characters and i enjoy the adventure they live however silly and i just find fascinating the idea that this adventure is actually taking place in a novel holds up under multiple viewings -m good show 	POS
i vaugely recall seeing this when i was years old then my parents accidentally taped over all but a few seconds of it with some other cartoon then i was about or years old when i rediscovered it and since i was then able to comprehend things better i thought it was a good movie then fast forward to just a few weeks ago june when i re-re discovered it thanks to some internet articles video clips and it s just not the same movie i m sure it s still good with the kids but to us - somethings it s definitely got cult status written all over it it s a shame that the original production went through a painful process; if fox gave it enough time it would probably be more recognized in the public eye today maybe if they were to remake it with a totally different story and an all star voice cast it could be but that s for fox to decide i m rambling here i know i still think it s a great film but it could be better than great 	POS
a few years ago a friend got from one of his other friends a video with the michael mann film heat on it after we finished that movie and were about to stand up we saw that there is another film just after tough on the cassette s envelope the owner didn t write it up yet we were all glued back to our seats by its distinct opening which lacked credits some two hours later i just sat there wondering: how could i not have heard of this masterpiece before this film was europa lars von trier woke film noir from the dead deconstructed reality with intentionally obvious sets yet often there was haunting similarity with post-war german photographs i saw and then the tricky cuts the story itself is a hard-to-take moral odyssey that has no happy end a young american pacifist of german descent comes to post-war germany intent on doing some good to pay for the bombs his countrymen dropped but he mostly meets distrust and self-destructive defiance he hires with zentropa a dining-and-sleeping-car company modeled on mitropa whose owner is one of the nazi collaborators the occupiers whitewash our hero falls in love with his daughter - who later turns out to be a member of the werewolf nazi post-war terrorists when he doesn t understand the world or just europeans anymore in his rage he blows up a railroad bridge under a train which he just saved as a final note for historical correctness: in the real world the werewolf were nowhere as important as the film implies they were mostly a final nazi propaganda coup after an ss unit assassinated the major of allied-occupied aachen two months before the capitulation the nazis announced the creation of whole legions of saboteurs and terrorists who will be ready to fight behind the lines the werewolf but only a few hundred of mostly hitler youth received some training and while two or three times some were deployed to murder suspected communists or forced-labourer foreigners in bavarian villages to imprint lasting fear on inhabitants with hitler s death and the war s end it all fell apart however the werewolf propaganda had a profound effect on the occupiers they feared the werewolf everywhere suspected it behind any serious accident - but without exception another cause was found later ignored by some recent pseudo-historians for example when a gas main exploded in the police hq of bombed-out bremen or when the soviet military commander died in a motorbike accident in berlin the effect was strongest on the soviets who arrested tens of thousands in large part children preemptively on suspicion of being werewolf and closed them off in prison camps where a lot of them died 	POS

i was very impressed with this film i would have to rate it as one of the better classic-era westerns i say that for the whole thing: the acting mature dialog no- nonsense story and excellent cinematography director anthony mann who did several well-photographed film noirs around this same era also made some westerns such as this one it has that same film-noir look mann and jimmy stewart collaborated on several westerns during this period if you like this movie i recommend the mann-stewart film bend of the river in a nutshell the story is about a man lin mcadam stewart who owns this prestigious winchester rifle a weapon he won fair-and-square in a contest it is then stolen and passed on from villain to villain all of those villains are interesting characters aiding stewart act out this interesting tale are shelley winters dan duryea stephen mcnally millard mitchell charles drake will greer and j c flippen all of them are fun to watch it was a bit of a stretch however to see rock hudson playing an indian young bull but you can t have everything 	POS

i had no problem with the film which i thought was pretty good it s the actual lapd crime scene video that disturbed me i wonder if lion s gate really thought that the general viewing audience would want to see people that were brutally beaten to death and blood all over the place sorry lion s gate this was an incredibly bad idea getting back to the film: the cast was excellent especially val kilmer as the late john holmes john holmes was a sleaze mistreats the women in his life lisa kudrow as his wife kate bosworth as his girlfriend and he is hopelessly deep into drugs his connection to eddie nash eric bogosian creates a spiral that resulted in the infamous wonderland murders exactly how much was holmes involved in the murders we may never know the entire truth to the story nash is still alive and a free man but the film does a pretty good job nonetheless 	POS

i m a big fan of films where people get conned and house of games is almost the pinnacle of the films where people get conned genre in short it s an exceptional thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat by providing interesting characters with many levels and never truly revealing what s happening while throwing in many twists and surprises to upset completely what you ve just seen the film cons the audience on many occasions and despite us knowing this; it s still difficult to guess where it s going and every twist comes off as a surprise as mentioned i m a big fan of cons in movies and the plot of this one follows a female psychiatrist who receives a patient with a huge debt owed to a fellow gambler she then goes to the gambler in an attempt to help out her patient and on the way gets drawn into the art of reading people in order to pull off a con house of games breathes a sleazy atmosphere throughout and david mamet does well in establishing his film s setting in the underground levels of the city the film is well acted also with all concerned bringing life and believability to their characters with the greatest of skill joe mantegna stars as the con man at the heart of the film and although his performance is a little under wrought he s always solid and believable as the villain of the piece lindsay crouse stars alongside him as the psychiatrist seduced by his work and again is believable in her role she may not be the greatest looker but at least she can act the way that the film executes it s plot is the main star of the show however and you will no doubt be amazed on multiple occasions as to how the film constantly manages to amaze and deceive the viewer at times it s almost like we are in the thick of the action and being conned by the con men in the film another thing that s great about this film is the way that it shows the audience how to pull off certain cons which is useful if you re interested in making twenty bucks say all in all house of games is a truly first rate thrill ride 	POS
i loved this movie i m a mexican and was in the least offended by it in fact i think this movie should be shown at police headquarters all over mexico it s a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a month old corpse it angers me to read in the news how killers kidnappers and other slime go free by paying a laughable fine or live like kings inside prison cells we should have someone like creasy denzel washington s character a bodyguard turned vengeful vigilante kidnapping is flourishing industry down here at least in the big cities i actually wish real life kidnappers could suffer the same fate as the one s creasy did his fine job upon that would be so marvelous sorry i am that resentful man on fire is a gripping film that you can t miss it might be hard on some of you if you aren t used to reading subtitles mexicans do that all the time while watching american movies but the effort will be well worth it some of the editing is a bit fuzzy kind of like traffic remember another brilliant take on how corrupt mexico is the movie starts out a bit slow but the pace picks up frantically by the second half i swear you ll be cheering as you watch denzel washington dispatch the wrong doers his performance is nothing short of excellent the ending no spoilers ok is a bit sad but i m sure you ll like it anyway man on fire is one of the year s best movies a must own for a dvd collection out of 	POS

slaughter high starts like any other day at doddsville county high school where little minx carol manning caroline munro has tricked resident nerd marty rantzen simon scuddamore into the girls locker rooms where she tells him to get undressed in the shower while doing so carol s gang of friends come in & give the now naked marty a big surprise as they film him as they stick his head down the girls toilet in an april fool s day joke the school s sports coach marc smith saves marty & punishes the gang who rather harshly blame marty they decide to play another trick on him only this time things get out of hand & marty is caught in an explosion & has nitric acid splashed over his face years later & the whole gang are invited to a class reunion at the now closed down school they all arrive to discover they are the only ones there they all venture inside where they quickly learn they aren t the only ones there as marty is back & has revenge on his mind originally shot under the title april fool s day which they changed probably because of another slasher film named april fool s day made the same year this american english co-production is unusual in that it has three credited writers & directors george dugdale mark ezra & peter litten after never seeing a film with three credited director s i ve now seen two in a week the other being the jean-claude van damme flick kickboxer & i have to say i really rather liked slaughter high even though it seems to have a pretty bad reputation one of the things i like about the script is that it is a pure unashamed slasher flick it doesn t try to be anything else & it just accepts the genres rules short comings & trappings & plays up to them basically it delivers what it promises a homicidal killer blood boobs & babes i thought the character s were alright the story was ok even though it s just an excuse to get a load of teens inside an isolated location so some killer can bump them off one at a time & i actually liked the twist ending as well which is also something for which slaughter high gets a lot of flak for the first half starts off a little slow but the second half moves along at a rate of knots as there is one gory killing after another some of the situations & character reactions make little sense but the same can be said of just about any film ever made so who s complaining despite three credited director s slaughter high turned out pretty good i liked the look of the film a lot the isolated rundown school made for a really atmospheric location & looked good the makers throw in a good thunderstorm as well & there s some nice photography especially at the end where there are numerous impressive uninterrupted long lasting stedicam tracking shots which follow carol through various corridors of the rundown school while not particularly stylish it certainly looks nice enough & is professionally made there is some good gore here including burnt bodies people melted with acid impalings stomach explosions axes in faces & death by lawnmower as well as someone who gets drowned in fecal matter down a drain the special effects are also better than one would expect & i was both impressed & pleased with the higher than expected body count technically the film is better than i had expected & beats most low budget horror crap that gets released today i would have thought it was relatively low budget itself though supposedly set in america this was very obviously shot in england harry manfredini composes another score which sounds exactly like all of his other musical scores & is basically the same as the theme from friday the th & it s sequels anyone living here in the uk will probably recognise billy hartman who played frank as a regular in emmerdale farm one of our nations top rated soap operas in which he plays terry woods while most horror fans will recognise the sexy caroline munro in a rare staring role legendary exploitation producer dick randall did the deed on slaughter high & actually appears in the film as a porno movie producer talk about typecasting you can also see a poster for the misunderstood brilliance that was pieces which he also produced behind him in his office slaughter high is a slasher film that i liked a lot did you see that i didn t say it was great i actually said i liked it on a personal level & i m sure the predictable plot & lack of story will probably put many off so i can t recommend it but i can say i liked it make of that what you want make sure you you watch the uncut version if you ever decide you want to check it out if your not a fan of the slasher flick genre then slaughter high won t change your mind but if your looking for a simple & effective slasher then you could do a lot worse than this 	POS

this film is an absolute classic for camp that is why it was an elvira and mst classic everyone knows the story scientist keeps his girlfriend s head alive in a lasagna pan in his basement while he cruises town and tries to find her a body by checking out the local chicks finally he finds a real hourglass body with a scar-faced chick s head on top the severed head makes friends with the failed experiment in the closet and the conehead comes out of the closet and rips off the assistant s remaining good arm his other is not right from a scientist s earlier failure and the whole place burns down the movie scared us so much as kids that my friend wouldn t go into his basement for a year after seeing it as kids we ranked the scariest movies of all time and this one was number four only one of those scary movies was really any good the original the haunting i had to give this movie a seven rating for the tremendous amount of entertainment value it offers its eerie effect because of the crappy production and the weird sexual angle when the scientist looks for the bodies complete with porno sound track scares the hell out of innocent children while the ridiculous aspects make it prime material for watching talking and laughing i could watch this film tonight and enjoy it while i d rather go to the dentist than watch chicago again seven is the most i can give it because its entertainment value is mere luck the film as cinema is a disaster 	POS
while there aren t any talking animals big lavish song production numbers or villians with half white half black hair it does have thing realistic people acting normally in a strange circumstance and walt & roy did in their eras with the studio if you thought think the castaways or the island at the top of the world weren t identical or you hold them to a higher authority than atlantis then your idealism is just as whacked as keeping your kids up till midnight to watch a friggin cartoon 	POS
